    <p>In this activity, you and your group will still be acting as
    nodes connected to a router.  But this time, the addresses of the
    nodes are not visible to you.  Pick one member of your group to be
    the DNS node.  To get the addresses of the other nodes, you must
    send a message to the DNS node asking for the address of a particular
    hostname.</p>
    <p>If you are the DNS node: Go to the DNS tab and click "Take over
    as DNS."</p>
