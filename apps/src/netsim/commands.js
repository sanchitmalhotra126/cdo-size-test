/**
 * A command is an operation that can be constructed with parameters now,
 * triggered later, and completed even later than that.
 *
 * Similar to a promise or a deferred, commands are useful for non-blocking
 * operations that need to take place with a particular relationship to time
 * or to one another - asynchronous calls that should happen in order, events
 * that should be triggered on a timeline, etc.  Instead of nesting callbacks
 * N-layers-deep, create a queue of commands to run.
 *
 * You'll usually want to define commands for your own unique needs.  A child
 * command should always call the Command constructor from its own constructor,
 * it will almost always need to override onBegin_, and it may want to override
 * tick and onEnd_.  Commands can call success() or fail() on themselves, or
 * wait for others to do so; usage is up to you.
