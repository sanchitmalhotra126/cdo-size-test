            off with simple shapes and builds up to more sophisticated sprite-based
            games, using the same programming concepts and the design process computer
            scientists use daily. In the final project, you’ll develop a personalized,

                paraan sa pagmarka o pagbigay ng pangalan sa isang numero. Ang mga
                estudyante ay gagamit ng mga variables para mag-save ng random na
                numero para makita na ang mga variables ay talagang nag-store at nag-save
                ng kanilang mga halaga, na nagbibigay-daan sa kanila na gamitin ang
                parehong random na numero nang maraming beses sa kanilang mga programa.

                more obvious physical inputs and outputs (e.g. a keyboard as an input
                or a screen as an output) but later discussions lead students to consider
                less obvious examples (e.g. that a touch screen is both an input and
                output, or the fact that the Internet can serve as both input and
                output). Throughout the lesson the teacher records inputs and outputs
                that are identified on a T-Chart at the front of the room. To conclude
                the lesson students examine common activities they do on a computing
                device and select the inputs and outputs used for that activity from
                the chart.
            Processing:
              name: Processing
              description_student: This lesson dives deeper into the concept of processing
                that was introduced as part of the definition of a computer.  Pairs
                work together to puta deck of cards in order, a form of processing
                information.  In the end, the class discusses what processing means
                within the context of solving information problems.
              description_teacher: Students complete two unplugged card sorting activities
                to explore the meaning of processing and its relationship to problem-solving.
                The first has few constraints and is used to introduce a high-level
                definition of processing. The next introduces more constraints that
                forces students to develop an algorithm that will always successfully
                process the cards. Students iteratively develop, test, and share their
                algorithms with classmates. A wrap-up discussion has students reflect
                on the different types of problem-solving they used in these activities
                and the value of producing an algorithm to solve a problem.
            Storage:
              name: Storage
              description_student: This lesson focuses on the storage component of
                the definition of a computer, within the content of processing information.
                The class spends the majority of the lesson developing and sharing
                algorithms to process information, with an emphasis on how much storage
                is needed for any particular algorithm. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion of the importance of storage while processing information.
              description_teacher: Students explore the importance of storage within
                the Input-Storage-Processing-Output model of a computer. The warm-up
                activity asks students to reflect on the types of information they
                have seen computers store in the past, like documents, photographs,
                or videos. The unplugged main activity has students develop an algorithm
                to process a small pile of cards in search of specific cards within
                the deck. Constraints on how students can move the cards force them
                to consider the importance of storage even while they are processing
                the deck. The lesson concludes with a discussion of the two types
                of storage students saw in this lesson and the importance of storage
                while processing information.

                personal website to talk about personal information people choose
                to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of
                information are good to share with other people, then looks at several
                sample social media pages to see what types of personal information
                could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class
                comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information
                online.
              description_teacher: |-
                As students have recently spent some time thinking about the actual content that will go into their personal website, this lesson takes a step back from the unit-long project (publication of a personal website) to help students articulate what personal information they choose to share digitally and with whom.  It also reinforces the notion that much of the information that they choose to share digitally falls largely out of their control the moment it is released.  \r
                \r
                Students begin by individually identifying appropriate audiences with whom they would be comfortable sharing given pieces of personal information.  They then look at several social media pages to determine what sorts of information people are sharing about themselves or one another.  Last, students reflect on what guidelines they think are appropriate for posting information online.\r
                \r
                The ultimate point of this lesson is not to scare students, but rather to experientially bring students to realizing precisely what level of control they don’t have in releasing information into the web.

                and unlikely animals.
              description_teacher: This lesson encourages students to think more critically
                about how web searches work and how to find relevant and trustworthy
                information online. After viewing and discussion a video about how
                search engines work, students will search for information about several
                unlikely animals. They'll need to analyze the sites they find for
                reliability in order to identify which of the animals is actually
                a hoax.

              name: Exploring Websites
              description_student: This lesson covers the purposes that a website
                might serve, both for the users and the creators. The class explores

                how each of those sites is useful for users and how it might also
                serve its creators.
              description_teacher: Every website has a purpose, a reason someone created
                it and others use it. In this lesson, students will start to consider
                the purposes a website might serve, both for the users and the creators.
                Students will explore a handful of the most-used websites in the United

                websites as a means of personal expression and develop a list of topics
                and interests that they would want to include on a personal website.
                To begin the lesson students brainstorm different ways that people
                express and share their interests and ideas. Students then look at
                a few exemplar websites made by students from a previous CS Discoveries
                course to identify ways they are expressing their ideas. Finally students
                brainstorm and share a list of topics and interests they might want

              description_student: This lesson introduces to HTML as a solution to
                the problem of how to communicate both the content and structure of
                a website to a computer. The lesson begins with a brief unplugged
                activity demonstrating the challenges of effectively communicating
                the structure of a web page. The class looks at an HTML page in Web
                Lab and discusses how HTML tags help solve this problem, then uses
                HTML to write the first web pages of the unit.

                page in Web Lab and discuss with their classmates how HTML tags help
                solve this problem. Students then write their first HTML. A wrap-up
                discussion helps to solidify the understanding of content vs. structure
                that was developed throughout the lesson.
            Headers:

              description_student: This lesson continues the introduction to HTML
                tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags
                to create page and section titles and learns how the different header
                elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize
                their content on the personal web pages that will be built across
                the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to
                structure text on web pages, this time with headers.  Students learn
                how the different header elements are displayed by default and practice
                using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start
                to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal
                web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they

                page project to add a new HTML page that includes the new tags.
              description_teacher: Students are introduced to ordered and unordered
                lists in HTML and work through a few levels in which they use the
                &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; tags.  They then go back to
                their project, where they add a new HTML page.  Inside the new page,
                they write the HTML to display a recipe, top ten list, or any other
                content that uses the new tags that they have learned.
            Intellectual Property and Images:
              name: Intellectual Property and Images
              description_student: This lesson covers how to use media such as images,
                video, or music created by others a website while respecting the rights
                of the creator of that media. After first studying Creative Commons
                licensing, the class learns how to add images to web pages, and how
                to give proper attribution when doing so.
              description_teacher: |-
                Starting with an discussion of their personal opinions on how others should be allowed to use their work, the class explores the purpose and role of copyright for both creators and users of creative content.  They then move on to an activity exploring the various Creative Commons licenses as a solution to the difficulty in dealing with copyright. \r
                \r
                Finally, with a common understanding of the restrictions of various Creative Commons licenses, students learn how to add images to their web pages using the &lt;img&gt; tag.

              description_student: This lesson covers classes and custom colors. The
                class first learns how to specify custom colors using RGB (red, green,
                blue) values, then applies these colors to a new Four Seasons web
                page, which uses CSS classes.  Using classes, the class adds more
                styles to the Four Seasons web page, then use them to style their
                personal websites.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students first learn how to specify
                custom colors using their RGB (red, green, blue) values.  They then
                apply these colors to a new Four Seasons web page, which uses CSS
                classes.  CSS classes allow web developers to treat groups of elements
                they want styled differently than other elements of the same type.
                Using classes, students add more styles to the Four Seasons web page,
                then use them to style their personal websites.

              description_student: In the last few days of the unit, the class finalizes
                their personal websites, working with peers to get feedback, review
                the rubric, and put the finishing touches on the site. To cap off
                the unit, everyone shares their projects and how they were developed.
              description_teacher: |
                Students have spent a lot of time throughout the unit working on their Personal Website. In the final couple of days students finalize their websites.  They work with peers to get feedback, put the finishing touches on the websites, review the rubric and reflect on their process. To cap off the unit, they will share their projects and also a overview of the process they took to get to that final design.\r

              description_student: This lesson continues the introduction to HTML
                tags, this time with headers.  The class practices using header tags
                to create page and section titles and learns how the different header
                elements are displayed by default.  Next, the class plans how to organize
                their content on the personal web pages that will be built across
                the unit and begins the first page of the project.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue to use HTML to
                structure text on web pages, this time with headings.  Students learn
                how the different heading elements are displayed by default and practice
                using them to create page and section titles.  Students then start
                to decide how they will organize their content on their own personal
                web pages.  In the last level, students begin the project that they
                will continue to work on throughout the unit.

          description: Unit 4 introduces the broader social impacts of computing.
            Through a series of design challenges, you will learn how to better understand
            the needs of others while developing a solution to a problem. The second
            half of the unit consists of an iterative team project, during which teams
            have the opportunity to identify a need that they care about, prototype
            solutions both on paper and in App Lab, and test solutions with real users
            to get feedback and drive further iteration.

              description_student: To kick off a unit devoted to group problem solving
                and devloping products for other users, students will begin by investigating
                the design of various everyday items. By considering how each item
                might have been designed with needs of specific users in mind, students
                can begin to see how taking a user-centered approach to designing
                products (both physical and digital) can make those products more
                useful and usable.

                lesson starts students thinking about how to design for another person
                by role-playing a user profile and reacting to a series of products.  Students
                will each receive a user profile describing a person. They will use
                that user’s characteristics to choose appropriate products, critique
                product design, and suggest improvements to design.

                Designers need to understand their users’ needs in order to create useful products.  This lesson encourages students to think about how to design for another person by role-playing as someone else using a user profile and reacting as that user to a series of products.  Each student is assigned a user profile describing a person, which they then use to choose appropriate products, critique product design, and suggest improvements to design.\r

                unit. Students will brainstorm a list of potential users of smart
                clothing. As a class they will then group these ideas into broad categories
                and each group will choose one category of user. Groups will repeat
                this process to brainstorm needs or concerns of their user, eventually
                categorizing these needs and choosing one to focus on. Students will
                then design a piece of smart clothing, using the specific needs and
                concerns they brainstormed to design their decision making. At the
                end of the class students will quickly share their decision-making
                process and get feedback on how well their product addresses the user
                need they selected.

                looking through several example apps, choosing one (or more) as a
                basis for the type of app they will make. From there, teams will have
                some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using
                3x5 index cards to develop paper prototypes.
              description_teacher: |
                Before starting to design apps, we need to help students to better scope their expectations. Because students will eventually be prototyping these apps in App Lab, they will be in better shape if their ideas align with the kinds of apps that are easily prototyped in App Lab. Teams start this scoping by looking through several example apps designed to demonstrate apps that can be created with App Lab. Teams then can chose one (or more) of the apps as a basis for their own. From there, teams have some time to discuss the basic functionality of their app before using 3x5 index cards to develop paper prototypes.\r

                In order to test the prototype with the users, the students will have
                to assign roles in the testing (the “narrator”, the “computer” and
                the “observers”) as well as have some questions prepared for the user
                to answer after the test is complete.

                to address user needs. In teams students will examine a paper prototype
                for an chat app. Through this examination students will get a chance
                to see how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas
                and assumptions before we ever get to the computer. In "using" the
                provided prototype students will begin to identify ways to improve
                the next iteration.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look
                towards the next phase of design, prototyping a product that attempts
                to address user needs. In teams students will examine a paper prototype
                for an chat app. Through this examination students will get a chance
                to see how a simple paper prototype can be used to quickly test ideas
                and assumptions before we ever get to the computer. In "using" the
                provided prototype students will begin to identify ways to improve
                the next iteration.
            Feedback and Prototypes:
              name: Feedback and Prototypes
              description_student: In this lesson students will use feedback from
                users of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order
                to develop improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype.
                The lesson begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need
                to translate human needs with technology into changes to the user
                interface or experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback
                and requests from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups
                students categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed
                in the feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app.
                Then in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet
                one of the needs they identified.

            Identifying User Needs:
              name: Identifying User Needs
              description_student: Up to this point we have focused on designing for
                users who are, to some degree, distanced from us. Whether through
                brainstorming, profiles, or text feedback, the connection to an end
                user has never been direct. In this lesson students pair up to become
                users for each other, allowing everyone to directly interview their
                end user and ask questions to better inform their design.

            Project - Paper Prototype:
              name: Project - Paper Prototype
              description_student: Based on the peer interview from the previous lesson,
                each student will come up with an idea for an app that will solve
                a user's problem. Students will create their own paper-prototype of
                the app by creating "screens" on individual notecards. A project guide
                directs students through the process including building the app and
                testing it with their user to see if their assumptions about the user
                interfaces they created are accurate.

            Linking Screens:
              name: Linking Screens
              description_student: Building on the screens that the class designed
                in the previous lesson, teams combine screens into a single app. Simple
                code can then be added to make button clicks change to the appropriate
                screen.
              description_teacher: In this lesson teams combine the screens that they
                designed in the previous lesson into a single app, which they can
                then link together using code. Students learn basic event driven programming
                by building up the model app that they started in the previous lesson.
                In addition to the screen that students designed yesterday, they'll
                learn how to create additional screens and even import screens made
                by others.
            User Interfaces:
              name: User Interfaces
              description_student: See how a paper prototype can be used to test and
                get feedback on software before writing any code. To help out a developer
                with their idea, the class tests and provides an app prototype made
                of paper.
              description_teacher: Following the mini design project, students look
                towards the next phase of design - prototyping a product that attempts
                to address user needs. In teams, students examine a paper prototype
                for a chat app called "Txt Ur Grndkdz". Through using this paper prototype,
                students get a chance to see how a simple paper prototype can be used
                to quickly test ideas and assumptions before we ever get to the computer.
                After "using" the provided prototype students begin to identify ways
                to improve the next iteration.
            Feedback and Testing:
              name: Feedback and Testing
              description_student: Users have been testing an app, and they have lots
                of feedback for the developer. The class needs to sort through all
                of this feedback, identify the common themes and needs, and start
                revising the prototype to make it better meet the users' needs.
              description_teacher: In this lesson students use feedback from "users"
                of the paper-prototyped app from the previous lesson in order to develop
                improvements to the user interface of that paper prototype. The lesson
                begins with a reflection on the fact that designers need to translate
                human needs with technology into changes to the user interface or
                experience. Students are then given a collection of feedback and requests
                from users of the app from the previous lesson. In groups students
                categorize the feedback and identify ways the needs expressed in the
                feedback could be met by changes to the interface of the app. Then
                in groups students will implement some of these changes to meet one
                of the needs they identified.
            Project - App Presentation:
              name: Project - App Presentation
              description_student: Each team prepares a presentation to "pitch" the
                app they've developed. This is the time to share struggles, triumphs,
                and plans for the future.
              description_teacher: At this point teams have researched a topic of
                personal and social importance, developed and tested both a paper
                prototype and a digital prototype, and iterated on the initial app
                to incorporate new features and bug fixes. Now is the time for them
                to review what they have done and pull together a coherent presentation
                to demonstrate their process of creation. Using the provided presentation
                template, teams prepare to present about their process of app development,
                including the problem they set out to solve, the ways in which they've
                incorporated feedback from testing, and their plans for the future.

          description: Unit 6 explores the role of hardware platforms in computing
            and how different sensors can provide more effective input and output
            than the traditional keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Using App Lab and Adafruit’s
            Circuit Playground, you’ll develop programs that utilize the same hardware
            inputs and outputs that you see in the smart devices, looking at how a
            simple rough prototype can lead to a finished product. The unit concludes
            with a design challenge to use the Circuit Playground as the basis for
            an innovation of your own design.

              description_teacher: To kick off the final unit of this course, students
                will do some research into interesting innovations in computing. This
                lesson will expose students to wider variety of computing form factors
                (what a computer looks like) and fields that are impacted by computing.
                Later in this unit students will look back on the devices they encountered
                in this lesson as they develop their own physical computing devices.

              description_teacher: In preparation for delving deeper into programming
                with App Lab, students will explore how a handful of different programs
                written in both Game Lab and App Lab handle taking input from the
                user. After comparing and contrasting the approaches they saw in the
                example apps, students group up to act out the two different models
                for input (conditionals in an infinite and asynchronous events) to
                gain a better understanding of how they work.

              description_teacher: In this lesson students review the material they
                learned about creating apps in App Lab from Unit 4 in order to prepare
                for a return to App Lab in this unit. This review should be modified
                to best meet the needs of your students and their experience and familiarity
                with programming in App Lab. In addition to the review the students
                will also experiment with a variety of new event types that they likely
                have not seen before.

                to write programs that use the Circuit Playground for output. After
                first inspecting the board visually and hypothesizing possibly functionalities,
                students move online where they will learn to write applications that
                blink an LED and make noise with a buzzer.

                loop repeats, and other code (such as event handlers) can be run between
                iterations of the loop. This allows us to create interesting animations
                that repeat infinitely, while still allowing other code to run alongside
                it.

                most interactions. To expand the kinds of apps that students can make,
                and to encourage them to think in new ways about how users interact
                with apps, we introduce the `setProperty()` block. This command can
                be used to set the content and properties of various UI elements,
                allowing students to write programs that update information on a single
                screen, instead of manually creating duplicate screens. In this lesson
                students build up simple apps that only require a single screen, the
                content of which is changed using `setProperty()`.
            Board Events:
              name: Board Events
              description_student: Using the hardware buttons and switch, the class
                develops programs that use the Circuit Playground as an input.
              description_teacher: This lesson transitions students from consider
                the Circuit Playground as strictly an output device towards using
                it as a tool for both input and output. Starting with the hardware
                buttons and switch,sing the hardware buttons and switch, students
                learn to use `onBoardEvent()`, analogously to `onEvent()`, in order
                to take input from their Circuit Playgrounds.
            Getting Properties:
              name: Getting Properties
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the getProperty
                block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements
                with code.  Students first practice using the block to determine what
                the user has input in various user interface elements. Students later
                use getProperty and setProperty together with the counter patters
                to make elements move across the screen.  A new screen element, the
                slider, and a new event trigger, onChange, are also introduced.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to the `getProperty`
                block, which allows them to access the properties of different elements

                the user has input in various user interface elements. Students later

            The Program Design Process:
              name: The Program Design Process
              description_student: This lesson introduces students to the process
                they will use to design programs of their own throughout this unit.
                This process is centered around a project guide which asks students
                to sketch out their screens, identify elements of the Circuit Playground
                to be used, define variables, and describe events before they begin
                programming. This process is similar to the Game Design Process that
                we used in Unit 3. In this lesson students begin by playing a tug
                o' war style game where the code is hidden. They discuss what they
                think the board components, events, and variables would need to be
                to make the program. They are then given a completed project guide
                which shows one way to implement the project. Students are then walked
                through this process through a series of levels. At the end of the
                lesson students have an opportunity to make improvements to the program
                to make it their own.

            'Project: Make a Game':
              name: 'Project: Make a Game'
              description_student: Students take what they've learned through chapter
                one, and develop an app of their own design that uses the board to
                output information.

            Arrays:
              name: Arrays
              description_student: Learn how lists can be used to store multiple values
                in a single variable name.
              description_teacher: An array is an ordered collection of items, usually
                of the same type. In this lesson, students learn ways to access either
                a specific or random value from a list using its index.  They then
                learn how to access the colorLEDs array that controls the behavior
                of the color LEDs on the Circuit Playground.  Students will control
                the color and intensity of each LED, then use what they have learned
                to program light patterns to create a light show on their Circuit
                Playground.
            Making Music:
              name: Paglikha ng Musika
              description_student: In this lesson students will use the buzzer to
                its full extent by producing sounds, notes, and songs with the buzzer.
                Students start with a short review of the buzzer's frequency and duration
                parameters, then move on to the concept of notes.  Notes allow students
                to constrain themselves to frequencies that are used in Western music
                and provide a layer of abstraction that helps them to understand which
                frequencies might sound good together.  Onces students are able to
                play notes on the buzzer, they use arrays to hold and play sequences
                of notes, forming simple songs.

            Arrays and For Loops:
              name: Arrays and For Loops
              description_student: Combining _lists_ and _for loops_ allows you to
                write code that impacts every element of a list, regardless of how
                long it is. The class uses this structure to write programs that process
                all of the elements in lists, include the list of color LEDs.
              description_teacher: Using a _for loop_ to iterate over all of the elements
                in an array is a really useful construct in most programming languages.
                In this lesson, students learn the basics of how a _for loop_ can
                be used to repeat code, and then combine it with what they've already
                learned about arrays to write programs that process all elements in
                an array. Students use for loops to go through each element in a list
                one at a time without having to write code for each element. Towards
                the end of the lesson students will apply this with the `colorLed`
                list on the board to create an app that changes all of the LEDs each
                time a button is clicked.
            Accelerometer:
              name: Accelerometer
              description_student: In this lesson, students will explore the accelerometer
                and its capabilities. They’ll become familiar with its events and
                properties, as well as create multiple programs utilizing the accelerometer
                similar to those they’ve likely come across in real world applications.

            Functions with Parameters:
              name: Mga function na meron mga parameter
              description_student: The lesson starts with a quick review of parameters,
                in the context of App Lab blocks that they students have seen recently.  Students
                then look at examples of parameters within user-created functions
                in App Lab and create and call functions with parameters for themselves,
                using them to control multiple elements on a screen.  Afterwards,
                students use for loops to iterate over an array, passing each element
                into a function.  Last, students use what they have learned to create
                a star catching game.

              description_teacher: In preparation for this chapter's final project,
                students will learn how to develop a prototype of a physical object
                that includes a Circuit Playground. Using a modelled project planning
                guide, students will learn how to wire a couple of simple circuits
                and to build prototypes that can communicate the intended design of
                a product, using cheap and easily found materials such as cardboard
                and duct tape.

          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems
            and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter
            explores different systems used to represent information in a computer
            and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter
            you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how
            computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes
            by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to
            an area of the your choosing.

                different systems they already use to represent yes-no responses.
                They then work in small groups to create a system that can represent
                any letter in the alphabet using only a single stack of cards. The
                cards used have one of 6 different possible drawings (6 animals, 6
                colors, etc.) and so to represent the entire alphabet students will
                need to use patterns of multiple cards to represent each letter. Students
                will create messages with their systems and exchange with other groups
                to ensure the system worked as intended. In the wrap-up discussion
                the class will review any pros and cons of the different systems.
                They will discuss commonalities between working systems and recognize
                that there are many possible solutions to this problem and what's
                important is that everyone use the same arbitrary system to communicate.

              description_student: In this lesson students learn to use their first
                binary system for encoding information, the ASCII system for representing
                letters and other characters. At the beginning of the lesson the teacher
                introduces the fact that computers must represent information using
                either "on" or "off". Then students are introduced to the ASCII system
                for representing text using binary symbols. Students practice using
                this system before encoding their own message using ASCII. At the
                end of the lesson a debrief conversation helps synthesize the key
                learning objectives of the activity.

            Representing Images:
              name: Representing Images
              description_student: In this lesson students learn how computers represent
                images. To begin the lesson they consider the challenge of turning
                all the complexity of vision into a binary pattern. Through a series
                of images showing how this transformation is made students are introduced
                to the concept of splitting images into squares or "pixels" which
                can then be turned on or off individually to make the entire image.
                Students then do a short set of challenges using the Pixelation Widget
                in order to draw black and white images. Puzzles are designed to call
                out some of the challenges of representing images in this way. In
                the wrap up students make connections between the system for representing
                images and the system for representing text they learned in the previous
                lesson.

            Combining Representations:
              name: Combining Representations
              description_student: In this lesson, students use all three types of
                binary representation systems (ASCII characters, binary number, and
                images) to decode information in a record.  After seeing a series
                of bits and being asked to decode them, students are introduced to
                the idea that in order to understand binary information, they must
                understand both the system that is being used and the meaning of the
                information encoded.  They then decode a record representing a pet
                based on a given structure.

            Project - Create a Representation:
              name: Project - Create a Representation
              description_student: In this lesson students design a structure to represent
                their perfect day using the binary representation systems they've
                learned in this chapter. Students will first write a short description
                of their perfect day and then review with a partner to identify the
                key pieces of information they think a computer could capture. As
                a class students will decide how a punch card of bytes of information
                will be interpreted to represent those pieces of information. Students
                will then use the ASCII, binary number, and image formats they have
                learned to represent their perfect days. Students then trade punch
                cards and try to decipher what the other student's perfect day is
                like. The lesson ends with a reflection.

              description_student: In this lesson students get practice making decisions
                with data based on some problems designed to be familiar to middle
                school students. Students work in groups discussing how they would
                use the data presented to make a decision before the class discusses
                their final choices. Not all questions have right answers and in some
                cases students can and should decide that they should collect more
                data. The lesson concludes with a discussion of how different people
                could draw different conclusions from the same data, or how collecting
                different data might have affected the decisions they made.

              description_student: In this lesson, students go further into the interpretation
                of data, including cleaning and visualizing raw data sets.  Students
                first look at the how presenting data in different ways can help people
                to understand it better.  They then visualize their own raw data set,
                in the context of a pizza topping survey, deciding what to do with
                data that does not easily fit into the visualization scheme that they
                have chosen.  Last, students look at what parts of this process can
                be automated, and what need a human to make decisions.

              description_student: In this lesson students look at a simple example
                of how a computer could be used to complete essentially every step
                of the data problem solving process. To begin students are given the
                clean data they collected about their ice cream preferences. They
                use a spreadsheet to visualize this data using simple charts and discuss
                in groups the decision they would make with this data. Students then
                create rules, or an algorithm, that a computer could use to make this
                decision automatically. Groups share their rules and what choices
                their rules would make with the class data. They then use their rules
                on data from another class to reinforce the fact that the rules they
                create should be useful for any data set. The lesson concludes with
                a discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of using computers to
                automate the data problem solving process.

              name: Problem Solving with Big Data
              description_student: In this lesson, students look at how data is collected
                and used by a organizations to solve problems in the real world. The
                lesson begins with a quick review of the data problem solving process
                they have explored in this unit. Then students are presented three
                scenarios that could be solved using data and they brainstorm the
                types of data they would want to solve them and how they could collect
                the data. Each problem is designed to reflect a real-world service
                that exists. After brainstorming students will watch a video about
                a real-world service and will record notes about what data is collected
                by the real-world service and how it is used. At the end of the lesson
                students record whether data was provided actively by a user, was
                recorded passively, or is collected by sensors.

                problem. Students will follow a project guide to complete this multi-day
                activity. In the first several steps students brainstorm problems,
                perform simple research, and define a problem of their choosing. They
                will then decide what kind of data they would want to collect, how
                it could be collected, and how it could be used. Students will perform
                a peer review and make any necessary updates to their project before
                preparing a presentation to their classmates.

                in a binary (base-2) number system by a collection of dots, students
                turn bits "on" or "off" by turning cards face up and face down, then
                observe the numbers that result from these different patterns.  Eventually,

              description_student: Students review the concept of binary numbers,
                and discuss that they need to know the bit-length of each number in
                order to decode a series of bits.  They then made a flippy-do, a paper
                manipulative that will help them to encode and decode 8-bit numbers
                (0-255).  After practicing with the flippy-do, students discuss how
                they could extend that standardization to the other types of data.

                about the process of encrypting information by enciphering a note
                for a partner and deciphering the partner's note.  The class concludes

This lesson will introduce students to the idea that frustration can be an important part of learning. Here, frustration is presented as a step in the creative process, rather than a sign of failure.\r

                already have plenty of practice using `repeat` loops, so now it's
                time to mix things up. \n\n_While loops_ are loops that continue to
                repeat commands while a condition is met. While loops are used when
                the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times commands need
                to be repeated, but does know what condition needs to be true in order
                for the loop to continue repeating. For example, students will be
                working to fill holes and dig dirt in Farmer. They will not know the
                size of the holes or the height of the mountains of dirt, but the

              description_teacher: |
                This lesson demonstrates how conditionals can be used to tailor a program to specific information. We don’t always have all of the information we need when writing a program. Sometimes you will want to do something different in one situation than in another, even if you don't know what situation will be true when your code runs. That is where conditionals come in. Conditionals allow a computer to make a decision, based on the information that is true any time your code is run.

                code that executes exactly the same way each time it is run - reliable,
                but not very flexible. In this lesson, your class will begin to code
                with conditionals, allowing them to write code that functions differently
                depending on the specific conditions the program encounters.

                and loops together!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be pairing together
                two key concepts: loops and conditionals. This set of puzzles bridges
                the gaps in understanding that occur when working on puzzles that
                use multiple kinds of blocks. By bringing two ideas together, students
                will create more complex code that shows both impressive creativity
                and critical thinking!'
            Conditionals & Loops in Farmer:
              name: Conditionals & Loops in Farmer
              description_student: It's not always clear when to use each conditional.  This
                lesson will help you get practice deciding what to do.
              description_teacher: Students will practice `while` loops, `until` loops,
                and `if / else` statements. All of these blocks use conditionals.
                By practicing all three, students will learn to write complex and
                flexible code.

              description_teacher: |-
                In collaboration with Common Sense Education, this lesson helps students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. Students learn the difference between private information and personal information, distinguishing what is safe and unsafe to share online.

                Students will also explore what it means to be responsible and respectful to their offline and online communities as a step toward learning how to be good digital citizens.

              description_teacher: Though many people think of binary as strictly
                zeros and ones, students will be introduced to the idea that information
                can be represented in a variety of binary options. This lesson takes
                that concept one step further as it illustrates how a computer can
                store even more complex information (such as images and colors) in
                binary, as well.
            Artist Binary:

                using only commands to turn pixels on and off.
              description_teacher: Binary is extremely important in the world of computers.
                The majority of computers today store all sorts of information in
                binary form. This lesson helps demonstrate how it is possible to take
                something from real life and translate it into a series of ons and
                offs. Students will build binary images in Artist by translating 0s
                and 1s to offs and ons (or blacks and whites).

                they can create so many beautiful things.  This lesson will take students
                through a series of exercises to help them create their own portfolio-ready
                images.

                each of them to get ideas for projects of your own!
              description_teacher: "The next four lessons provide an opportunity for
                students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project.
                This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and
                produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. Intended to
                be a multi-lesson or multi-week experience, students will spend time
                exploring brainstorming, learning about the design process, building,
                and presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students
                will be able to view pre-built examples of projects in both Artist
                and Play Lab for inspiration. Next, students will learn about the
                design process and how to implement it in their own projects. They
                will then be given the space to create their own project in either
                Artist or Play Lab (this is likely the longest stage of the project).
                Finally, students will be able to present their finished work to their
                peers."
            The Design Process:
              name: The Design Process
              description_student: Projects this big take time and plenty planning.
                Here, you will learn about the design process that you'll use to build
                your own creation.
              description_teacher: Over the course of four lessons, students will
                be building up to programming a project of their own design using
                either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. In this
                portion of the project, students will learn about the design process
                and how to implement it in their own projects. The lesson guide for
                all four stages of the process can be found in the first stage of
                this project process [here](https://curriculum.code.org/csf/coursee/12/).

                time to start building your project.
              description_teacher: Over the course of four lessons, students will
                be building up to programming a project of their own design using
                either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. Now the
                students will be given their own space to create their project with
                either Artist or Play Lab. This is likely to be the longest stage
                of the project. The lesson guide for all four stages of the process

            'Algorithms: Dice Race':
              name: 'Algorithms: Dice Race'
              description_student: Learn how to describe a game from the computer's
                point of view in this lesson on algorithms.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will relate the concept
                of algorithms back to real-life activities by playing the Dice Race
                game. The goal here is to start building the skills to translate real-world
                situations to online scenarios and vice versa.
            Conditionals:
              name: Mga conditional
              description_student: You will get to tell the computer what to do under
                certain conditions in this fun and challenging series.
              description_teacher: This lesson introduces students to `while` loops
                and `if / else` statements. _While loops_ are loops that continue
                to repeat commands as long as a condition is true. While loops are
                used when the programmer doesn't know the exact number of times the
                commands need to be repeated, but the programmer does know what condition
                needs to be true in order for the loop to continue looping. `If /
                Else` statements offer flexibility in programming by running entire
                sections of code only if something is true, otherwise it runs something
                else.
            Private and Personal Information:
              name: Private and Personal Information
              description_student: The internet is fun and exciting, but it's important
                to stay safe too. This lesson teaches you the difference between information
                that is safe to share and information that is private.
              description_teacher: |-
                Developed by Common Sense Education, this lesson is about the difference between information that is safe to share online and information that is not.

                As students visit sites that request information about their identities, they learn to adopt a critical inquiry process that empowers them to protect themselves and their families from identity theft. In this lesson, students learn to think critically about the user information that some websites request or require. They learn the difference between private information and personal information, as well as how to distinguish what is safe or unsafe to share online.
            Build a Star Wars Game:
              name: Build a Star Wars Game
              description_student: Feel the force as you build your own Star Wars
                game in this lesson.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will practice using events
                to build a game that they can share online. Featuring R2-D2 and other
                Star Wars characters, students will be guided through events, then
                given space to create their own game.
            'Functions: Songwriting':
              name: 'Functions: Songwriting'
              description_student: Even rockstars need programming skills. This lesson
                will teach you about functions using lyrics from songs.
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions can be such a helpful practice.
            Functions in Artist:
              name: Functions in Artist
              description_student: Make complex drawings more easily with functions!
              description_teacher: Students will be introduced to using functions
                on Code.org. Magnificent images will be created and modified with
                functions in Artist. For more complicated patterns, students will
                learn about nesting functions by calling one function from inside
                another.
            Functions in Bee:
              name: Functions in Bee
              description_student: Don't write too much code to gather all of the
                nectar and honey. Use functions instead!
              description_teacher: In the second round of practice with online functions,
                students will navigate complex paths, collect plenty of nectar, and
                make lots of honey.
            Functions in Farmer:
              name: Functions in Farmer
              description_student: Functions will save you lots of work as you help
                the farmer with her harvest!
              description_teacher: Students have practiced creating impressive designs
                in Artist and navigating mazes in Bee, but today they will use functions
                to harvest crops in Farmer. This lesson will push students to use
                functions in the new ways by combining them with `while` loops and
                `if / else` statements.
            Determine the Concept:
              name: Determine the Concept
              description_student: "We aren't giving away any secrets! \nThis lesson
                could use any of the skills you've learned so far."
              description_teacher: This lesson brings together concepts from the previous
                lessons and gives students a chance to think critically about how
                they would solve each problem, but without telling them which concept
                to apply. Students will review basic algorithms, debugging, `repeat`
                loops, conditionals, `while` loops, and functions.
            Build a Play Lab Game:
              name: Build a Play Lab Game
              description_student: Practice making games to share with your friends
                and family.
              description_teacher: This lesson features Play Lab, a platform where
                students can create their own games and have interactions between
                characters and user input. Students will work with events to create
                keyboard controls. This set of puzzles will also loosely guide students
                through game development, but with freedom to add their own ideas.
            Present Your Project:
              name: Present Your Project
              description_student: Get ready to show off! It's time to present your
                finished project to your peers.
              description_teacher: Over the course of four lessons, students will
                be building up to programming a project of their own design using
                either Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. Finally,
                students will be able to present their finished work to their peers
                or share with their loved ones with a special link. The lesson guide
                for all four stages of the process can be found in the first stage
                of this project process [here](https://curriculum.code.org/csf/coursee/12/).

              description_student: Ever wondered how information travels across the
                internet? It's not magic! This lesson will teach you the basics of
                how the internet works.
              description_teacher: Even though many people use the internet daily,
                not very many know how it works. In this lesson, students will pretend
                to flow through the internet, all the while learning about connections,
                URLs, IP Addresses, and the DNS.
            Crowdsourcing:
              name: Crowdsourcing
              description_student: This lesson will teach you about crowdsourcing,
                the process of building a project with a team.
              description_teacher: In computer science, we face some big, daunting
                problems. Challenges such as finding large prime numbers or sequencing
                DNA are almost impossible to do as an individual. Adding the power
                of others makes these tasks manageable. This lesson will show your
                students how helpful teamwork can be in the industry of computer science.

          description: Created with fourth grade students in mind, this course begins
            with a brief review of concepts previously taught in courses C and D.
            This introduction is intended to inspire beginners and remind the experts
            of the wonders of computer science. Students will practice coding with
            algorithms, loops, conditionals, and events before they are introduced
            to functions. At the end of the course, students will have the opportunity
            to create a capstone project that they can proudly share with peers and
            loved ones.

            'Algorithms: Tangrams':
              name: 'Algorithms: Tangrams'
              description_student: Here you will learn about algorithms using puzzles
                called tangrams!
              description_teacher: This lesson shows us something important about
                algorithms. As long as you keep an algorithm simple, there are lots
                of ways to use it. However, if you want to make sure everyone produces
                the same outcome, then your algorithm needs more detail. Students
                will learn the difference between a detailed and general algorithm
                while playing with tangrams.
            Introduction:
              name: Panimula
              description_student: This lesson will give you a brief introduction
                to some of the amazing things you will learn in this course!
              description_teacher: 'In this lesson, students will be introduced to
                sequences, loops, and nested loops to prepare them for more complicated
                concepts in the later part of the course. This "ramp up" lesson equalizes
                the playing field between the experts and the beginners in your class. '
            The Power of Words:
              name: The Power of Words
              description_student: Bullying is never okay. This lesson will teach
                you about what is and isn't okay to say online.
              description_teacher: "Students consider that while they are enjoying
                their favorite websites they may encounter messages from other kids
                that can make them feel angry, hurt, sad, or fearful. They explore
                ways to handle cyberbullying and how to respond in the face of upsetting
                language online.\n\nStudents discuss all the ways they use technology
                for communication and explore the similarities and differences between
                in-person and online communication. Students then brainstorm ways
                to respond to cyberbullying. "
            Ice Age Play Lab:
              name: Ice Age Play Lab
              description_student: Think of your favorite video game. Ever wondered
                how it was made? In these puzzles you will develop a video game of
                your own with friends from Ice Age!
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students are guided through a story
                featuring characters from Ice Age. Students will work with events
                and loops to make characters move on the screen, and will get the
                chance to create their own game or story after the guided levels.
            Envelope Variables:
              name: Envelope Variables
              description_student: 'Envelopes and variables have something in common:
                both can hold valuable things. Here you will learn what variables
                are and the awesome things they can do.'
              description_teacher: Variables are used as placeholders for values such
                as numbers or words. Variables allow for a lot of freedom in programming.
                Instead of having to type out a phrase many times or remember an obscure
                number, computer scientists can use variables to reference them. This
                lesson helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them
                in many different ways. The idea of variables isn't an easy concept
                to grasp, so we recommend allowing plenty of time for discussion at
                the end of the lesson.
            Variables in Artist:
              name: Variables in Artist
              description_student: Don't forget to bring creativity to class! In these
                puzzles you will be making fantastic drawings using variables.
              description_teacher: In this lesson, students will explore the creation
                of repetitive designs using variables in the Artist environment. Students
                will learn how variables can be used to make code easier to write
                and easier to read. After guided puzzles, students will end in a freeplay
                level to show what they have learned and create their own designs.
            Variables in Play Lab:
              name: Variables in Play Lab
              description_student: Soon you will learn about making characters interact
                in a game using variables!
              description_teacher: Students will get further practice with variables
                in this lesson by creating scenes in Play Lab. Students will work
                with user input to set the values of their variables, then get space
                to create their own mini-project with variables.
            For Loop Fun:
              name: For Loop Fun
              description_student: You're going to have loads of fun learning about
                `for` loops!
              description_teacher: 'We know that loops allow us to do things over
                and over again, but now we’re going to learn how to use loops that
                have extra structures built right in. These new structures will allow
                students to create code that is more powerful and dynamic. '
            For Loops in Bee:
              name: For Loops in Bee
              description_student: Buzz buzz. In these puzzles you will be guiding
                a bee to nectar and honey using `for` loops!
              description_teacher: Featuring Bee, this lesson focuses on for loops
                and using an incrementing variable to solve more complicated puzzles.
                Students will begin by reviewing loops from previous lessons, then
                walked through using for loops to more effectively solve complicated
                problems.
            For Loops in Artist:

                make some fantastic songs!
              description_teacher: One of the most magnificent structures in the computer
                science world is the function. Functions (sometimes called procedures)
                are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger
                program. This lesson will help students intuitively understand why
                combining chunks of code into functions is such a helpful practice,
                and how they can use those structures even when chunks of code are
                slightly different.

              description_teacher: In this lesson, students continue working with
                functions with and without parameters. Students will get the chance
                to create their own drawings with and without parameters, before modifying
                functions in a freeplay level.

              description_teacher: "The next five lessons provide an opportunity for
                students to put their coding skills to use in a capstone project.
                This project will help individuals gain experience with coding and
                produce an exemplar to share with peers and loved ones. This is intended
                to be a multi-lesson or multi-week project where students spend time
                brainstorming, learning about the design process, building, and then
                presenting their final work. \n\nIn the explore stage, students will
                be able to view examples of projects in both Artist and Play Lab for
                inspiration. Next, students will learn about the design process and
                how to implement it in their own projects. They will then be given
                the space to create their own project in either Artist or Play Lab
                (this is most likely the longest stage of the project). Students will
                then revise their projects, after testing and extra thought. Finally,

              description_teacher: Over the course of five lessons, students will
                be building up to building a project of their own design using either
                Play Lab or Artist as their programming environment. In this portion
                of the project, students will learn about the design process and how
                to implement it in their own projects. The lesson guide overviewing

          description_short: Learn how people use computers to solve data problems.
          description: Unit 5 is about the importance of data in solving problems
            and highlights how computers can help in this process. The first chapter
            explores different systems used to represent information in a computer
            and the challenges and tradeoffs posed by using them. In the second chapter
            you’ll learn how collections of data are used to solve problems, and how
            computers help to automate the steps of this process. The chapter concludes
            by considering how the data problem solving process can be applied to
            an area of the your choosing.
