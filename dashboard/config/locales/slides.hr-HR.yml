        text: Dobrodošli u svoj prvi sat koda! Bacimo se na prve korake programiranja.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc1_2.jpg
        text: Koristit ćemo Blockly, vizualan jezik za programiranje gdje vučete i
          ispuštate blokove da biste pisali kod.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc1_3.jpg
        text: Uglavnom se kod piše, ali Blockly je vizualan. Svaki blok odgovara jednoj
          liniji "pravog" koda.

        text: Naučit ćeš osnove računalstva, koncepta koji se koriste bilo gdje od
          izrade aplikacija do upravljanja robotom na Marsu.
      5:
        image: notes/hoc1_5.jpg
        text: Program je niz naredbi koje vaše računalo izvršava.

        image: notes/hoc1_6.jpg
        text: Cilj vašeg prvog programa je da Angry Bird prođe kroz labirint i udari
          Zelenu svinju.
      7:
        image: notes/hoc1_7.jpg
        text: Na lijevoj strani labirinta se pokreće vaš program. Upute za svaki zadatak
          su ispod labirinta.
      8:
        image: notes/hoc1_8.jpg
        text: Alatna traka u sredini sadrži naredbe za igru Angry Bird. Njih ćeš koristiti
          kako bi napisao svoj kod igre.
      9:
        image: notes/hoc1_9.jpg
        text: Na desnoj strani je vaša radna ploha gdje vučete blokove iz alatnice
          da biste napisali program. Da biste obrisali blok, odvucite ga do smeća
          u kutu.
      10:
        image: notes/hoc1_10.jpg
        text: Svaki blok je jedna naredba. Ako povučeš "pomakni naprijed" blok na
          svoju radnu površinu i pritisneš "Pokreni program", ptica se pomiče za jedno
          mjesto na podlozi.
      11:
        image: notes/hoc1_11.jpg
        text: Da izvršiš više od jedne radnje, povuci nekoliko naredbi na svoju radnu
          površinu i spoji ih zajedno. Ptica će slijediti naredbe odozgo prema dolje.
      12:
        image: notes/hoc1_12.jpg
        text: Ako si pokrenuo program i želiš ispraviti pogreške i pokušati ponovo,
          pritisni "Reset" tipku.

        text: U ovim zadacima, bit ćete umjetnik koji crta linije gdje god ide.
      3:
        image: notes/stage5_3.jpg
        text: Ovaj naredba kaže "pomakni naprijed" za 100 piksela. Pikseli su jako
          male točkice na tvom zaslonu.
      4:
        image: notes/stage5_4.jpg
        text: Ovaj blok kaće "skreni lijevo 90 stupnjeva." Ovo će okrenuti vašeg umjetnika
          za isti broj kao i broj blokova "okreni" u zadatku s labirintom.
      5:
        image: notes/stage5_5.jpg
        text: Pritisni strelicu u bilo kojem od blokova da promijeniš koliko umjetnik
          ide naprijed ili se okreće. Igraj se da bi se upoznao/la s ovim novim blokovima.
    farmer_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/stage9_1.jpg
        text: Bok, ja sam Paola! U ovim zadacima, bit ćeš farmer koji mora potpuno
          poravnati svoje polje da bi mogao početi sijati usjeve.
      2:
        image: notes/stage9_2.jpg
        text: Moraš pomoći ukloniti sve hrpe zemlje i popuniti sve rupe.
      3:
        image: notes/stage9_3.jpg
        text: Novi blokovi uklanjaju jednu lopatu zemlje iz hrpe i pune jednu lopatu
          zemlje u rupe.
      4:
        image: notes/stage9_4.jpg
        text: Hrpe i rupe su različite veličine, moraš reći farmerici koliko lopata
          mora koristiti.
    flappy_intro:
      1:
        image: notes/flappy01.jpg
        text: Bok, ja sam Katie! Jedna od najuzbudljivijih stvari u informatici je
          da kompjuterski program može biti interaktivan.
      2:
        image: notes/flappy02.jpg
        text: Kad god netko pritisne ili dotakne tipku na kompjuteru ili telefonu,
          to stvara DOGAĐAJ, i nekakav kod odlučuje što napraviti kad se dogodi DOGAĐAJ.
      3:
        image: notes/flappy03.jpg
        text: 'Na primjer, možeš imati RUKOVATELJA-DOGAĐAJEM koji kaže "kad se klikne
          miš, pokreni zvuk" '
      4:
        image: notes/flappy04.jpg
        text: Jesi ikad čuo za igricu FlappyBird? Koristeći rukovatelje događajem,
          naučit ćemo kako programirati našu vlastitu verziju igrice FlappyBird!
      5:
        image: notes/flappy05.jpg
        text: Kod koji ćeš napisati uključuje povlačenje i ispuštanje blokova koji
          predstavljaju zapovijedi za kompjuter. Ispod haube, svaki od ovih blokova
          predstavlja pravi kod.
      6:
        image: notes/flappy06.jpg
        text: 'Ako baciš pogled na radnu plohu, vidjet ćeš zelene blokove koji su
          već popunjeni - oni su "rukovatelji događajem" '
      7:
        image: notes/flappy07.jpg
        text: If you want the bird to FLAP when you CLICK the mouse, you can do that
          by attaching the "FLAP" block to the appropriate event handler, and now
          in your game whenever you click the mouse, the bird will flap.
      8:
        image: notes/flappy08.jpg
        text: In each puzzle of this activity we'll introduce new types of events
          as green blocks on the workspace, and you can decide the appropriate blocks
          to add in response to those events.
      9:
        image: notes/flappy09.jpg
        text: When you see a drop down arrow like this, that means you can change
          the settings - like what sound to play when flappy hits the ground.
      10:
        image: notes/flappy10.jpg
        text: In the final puzzle you'll be able to create your own game and share
          it with your friends. Have fun!

        text: Bok, ja sam Mark. Naučimo sada petlje. Koristeći petlje možete reći
          računalu da ponavlja bilo koju grupu radnji iznova, tisuću ili čak milijardu
          puta.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc2_2.jpg
        text: In this puzzle, we want to make the bird move forward 5 spaces to get
          to the pig.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc2_3.jpg
        text: Za pomoć možemo koristiti novi "ponovi" blok.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc2_4.jpg
        text: Umjesto korištenja 5 "pomakni naprijed" blokova ...
      5:
        image: notes/hoc2_5.jpg
        text: Možemo umetnuti "pomakni naprijed" blok u "ponovi" blok i upisati broj
          koji govori koliko se puta blok ponavlja.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc2_6.jpg
        text: 'Ovo je važno : moguće je umetnuti više od jedne naredbe u "ponovi"
          blok.'
      7:
        image: notes/hoc2_7.jpg
        text: Enjoy using your new "repeat" block!
    loop_until:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc3_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Chris. Before joining the Miami Heat, I went to Georgia Tech
          to study Computer Science. Let's try our new block, the "repeat until" block.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc3_2.jpg
        text: What if we didn't know how far the bird had to move to get to the pig?
      3:
        image: notes/hoc3_3.jpg
        text: If we put a "move forward" block inside the "repeat until" block, the
          bird will move forward UNTIL it reaches the pig (or crashes into a wall).
      4:
        image: notes/hoc3_4.jpg
        text: 'And this is important: just like before, we can put multiple blocks
          inside the "repeat until" block, and they will all be repeated.'
    if:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc4_1.jpg
        text: 'Hi, I''m Bill! Let''s learn a new fundamental concept: "If" statements.
          This is how computers make decisions.'
      2:
        image: notes/hoc4_2.jpg
        text: You use "If" statements yourself everday. Before you go outside each
          morning, you say IF it's raining outside, I need to wear my jacket.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc4_3.jpg
        text: We can tell the zombie to check IF there's path to the left, and if
          he finds a path to the left, we can have him turn in that direction.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc4_4.jpg
        text: To write the code for this, let's drag out our "if" block and put a
          "turn left" block inside it.
      5:
        image: notes/hoc4_5.jpg
        text: Now, if we put a "move forward" block above it and a "repeat" block
          around everything, each time the zombie moves, he'll check if there's a
          path to the left and turn. The "repeat" command is critical, to check for
          a turn at every step.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc4_6.jpg
        text: If statements are really important in computer science. One of the first
          programs I wrote was a tic-tac-toe game, and there was a If statement that
          said IF the other person is about to win, block the spot that lets them
          win.
      7:
        image: notes/hoc4_7.jpg
        text: Have fun using the "if" block!
    if_else:
      1:
        image: notes/hoc5_1.jpg
        text: Hi, my name is Saloni. I use computer science to help solve problems
          in health and medicine. Let's learn about the "if else" block. It looks
          like the "if" block, but it has an extra part at the end that says "else".
      2:
        image: notes/hoc5_2.jpg
        text: If I put a "move forward" block in the spot where it says "do" and a
          "turn left" block where it says "else" that means that the zombie will choose
          between 2 options. IF there is a path ahead, the zombie will move forward,
          and OTHERWISE (there isn't a path ahead), the zombie will turn left.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc5_3.jpg
        text: Poput "ako" bloka, moguće je umetnuti "ako inače" blok unutar "ponovi"
          bloka tako da zombi se nastavi kretati i "ako inače" blok će nastaviti provjeravati
          postoji li mogućnost skretanja zombija.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc5_4.jpg
        text: Sada, odvedi tog zombija kamo pripada!
    if_else_scrat:
      1:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat1.jpg
        text: An if-else statement is a decision between two things. Let's see how
          we can use an if-else statement with our buddy Scrat the squirrel.
      2:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat2.jpg
        text: This block looks the same as the "if" block, but there's an extra part
          at the bottom that says "else". If I put a "move forward" block where it
          says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else", that means Scrat
          the squirrel will move forward if there's a path ahead. If there's not a
          path ahead, Scrat will turn left.
      3:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat3.jpg
        text: It's making a decision and doing one of the two actions based on that
          decision. And just like "if" blocks, you can put "if-else" blocks inside
          "repeat" blocks.
      4:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat4.jpg
        text: Now let's help Scrat the squirrel get that acorn!
    function:
      1:
        image: notes/stage13_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Brina, an engineer at Instagram. A function is certain lines
          of code that you want to use over and over again, so instead of writing
          that code out everytime, you can just use one block.
      2:
        image: notes/stage13_2.jpg
        text: We're going to learn how to define functions. Function definitions have
          a star in the corner. The name of the function is written on the top line.
      3:
        image: notes/stage13_3.jpg
        text: The blocks that go inside the definition tell us what it does. So this
          function definition is called "fill 5" and it's made up of a "repeat" block
          and a "fill" block.
      4:
        image: notes/stage13_4.jpg
        text: The definition sits on the workspace, but our farmer won't run the function
          until we drag out our "fill 5" function block from functions category.
      5:
        image: notes/stage13_5.jpg
        text: 'Let''s put the "fun" back in "FUNction!" '
    loop_while:
      1:
        image: notes/stage9_5.jpg
        text: 'Hi, I''m Makinde! Let''s learn about the "while block." '
      2:
        image: notes/stage9_6.jpg
        text: The "while block" will do whatever you put inside it AS LONG AS the
          statement on the top is TRUE.
      3:
        image: notes/stage9_7.jpg
        text: For example, if the farmer is standing on a pile, she will continue
          to remove 1 shovelful WHILE there is still a pile beneath her.
    loop_for:
      1:
        image: notes/stage11_1.jpg
        text: Hi, I'm Trina, and I work for Pixar. I've worked on a bunch of movies,
          including Shrek.
      2:
        image: notes/stage11_2.jpg
        text: This is our new "counter" loop. It will perform actions over and over
          again and you can make the actions change slightly each time.
      3:
        image: notes/stage11_3.jpg
        text: In this example, our "counter" loop says "count with counter from 50
          to 90 by 10" and inside it, we have our "draw a square" block. Drag the
          "counter" block from the "Variables" section into the "length" spot.
      4:
        image: notes/stage11_4.jpg
        text: This means our artist is going to draw a square that has 50 pixel length
          sides, then it will add 10 to that and draw a square with 60 pixel length
          sides. Then it will keep adding 10 and drawing squares until it reaches
          90. So we'll have squares of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90.

        image: notes/stage15_2.jpg
        text: What if we want to draw a bunch of triangles and have their lengths
          be different sizes?
      3:
        image: notes/stage15_3.jpg
        text: We could write all that code out by hand or we can use a function with
          parameters.
      4:
        image: notes/stage15_4.jpg
        text: To do this, click the blue star on the "draw a triangle" function definition.
          Then drag "input name" into the "input" block.
      5:
        image: notes/stage15_5.jpg
        text: Then if you write "length" in the spot where it says "x" and press "Enter"
          you'll create a length input for your function.
      6:
        image: notes/stage15_6.jpg
        text: Then click on the star. Now, you want to click on the variables category
          and drag the "length" block into the "move forward" block of your function
          definition. And drag away the old number block.
      7:
        image: notes/stage15_7.jpg
        text: To use your function with parameters, click on the functions category
          and drag out your "draw a triangle with length" function.
      8:
        image: notes/stage15_8.jpg
        text: Now you can use the math block to input different numbers to draw triangles
          of different sizes.

      3:
        image: notes/frozen1_3.jpg
        text: In the next hour, you're going to learn the basics of how to code. Traditional
          programming is usually in text, but we'll use Blockly, which uses visual
          blocks that you can drag and drop to write programs. This is how even university
          students learn the basics. Under the hood, you're still creating code.
      4:

        text: A program is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
          Let's build a code, or a program, that will help Elsa create a simple line.
          We will use this later to create more complex patterns.

          we press "Run", what happens? Elsa moves forward a certain amount on the
          screen, 100 pixels in fact! Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your
          computer screen.

        text: The other block we have in this puzzle says "turn right by 90 degrees."
          And when we use this "Turn Right" block, that makes Elsa turn a certain
          amount. You can play around with how far you want Elsa to turn. The angle
          is measured from the path ahead of Elsa. So, this is a 90 degree turn. And
          this is a 120 degree turn.

        text: Hi, I’m Paola! Computers are really good at repeating actions. You can
          count to 10, 20, or 100. But a computer can count to a billion or a trillion.
          It won't get bored and it will only take a few seconds. Whether it's counting,
          or drawing, or anything--computers can repeat things hundreds or even billions
          of times.

        text: To draw a square, you can use the "Move Forward" and "Turn Right" block
          4 times. But the easier way is to tell the computer to "Move Forward" and
          "Turn Right by 90 degrees" once, and then tell it to repeat this pair of
          actions 4 times. To do that, you need to put the "Move Forward" and "Turn
          Right" block inside a "Repeat" block.

        text: One of the most important concepts in computer science is how to define
          new commands. Most computer languages have only about 100 words or commands.
          And really, the art and magic is in defining your own new words out of these
          building blocks.

        text: Once you've taught a computer how to do an action once using this sequence
          of commands, you can make up your own name for that action so it's easy
          to repeat it later. When you define your own command and give it a name,
          that's called a function.

        text: Hi, I’m Jess. When programming with blocks, you would use functions
          if there are a set of actions you would like to use lots of times. For example,
          you've written code to create a square.

          alinens, and animals speak, move, and interact with each other. By the end
          of this tutorial, you can build a game from scratch and share it with your
