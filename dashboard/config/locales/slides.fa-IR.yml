          رویداد، می‌خواهیم یاد بگیریم که نسخه سفارشی خودمون از FlappyBird را برنامه‌نویسی
          کنیم!
      5:
        image: notes/flappy05.jpg
        text: کدی که خواهی نوشت، شامل کشیدن و انداختن بلوک‌هایی است که نماینده دستوراتی
          برای کامپیوتر است. در پشت صحنه، هر یک از این بلوک‌ها با کد واقعی نشان داده
          می‌شوند.

        text: سلام من کریس هستم. قبل از پیوستن به میامی هیت، من برای تحصیل علوم کامپیوتر
          به دانشگاه جورجیا تک رفتم. بیایید بلوک جدید "repeat until" را امتحان کنیم.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc3_2.jpg
        text: چگونه میتوانیم بدانیم که چقدر پرنده باید حرکت کند که به خوک برسد؟
      3:
        image: notes/hoc3_3.jpg
        text: اگر ما بلوک "move forward" را در داخل بلوک "repeat unit" قرار دهیم,
          پرنده به جلو حرکت خواهد کرد تا اینکه به خوک برسد (یا اینکه با دیواد برخورد
          کند).
      4:
        image: notes/hoc3_4.jpg
        text: 'و این مهم است: درست مثل قبل، ما می توانیم چند تا بلوک را داخل بلوک
          "repeat until" قرار دهیم، و آنها تکرار خواهند شد.'

        text: 'سلام, من بیل هستم! اجازه دهید یک مفهوم اساسی جدید را یاد بگیریم: بیانیه
          "if". این نشان میدهد که چگونه کامپیوترها تصمیم گیری می کنند.'
      2:
        image: notes/hoc4_2.jpg
        text: شما هر روز بیانیه "if" را استفاده می کنید. قبل از اینکه شما هر روز صبح
          از خانه خارج شوید، شما می گویند اگر بیرون باران بیاید، آن وقت من نیاز دارم
          که ژاکت بپوشم.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc4_3.jpg
        text: ما می توانیم به آدم خورها بگوییم که بررسی کنند اگر مسیری در چپ وجود
          دارد، و اگر او بتواند مسیری در سمت چپ پیدا کند، ما به او اجازه می دهیم که
          به آن سمت بچرخد.
      4:
        image: notes/hoc4_4.jpg
        text: برای نوشتن این کد، بیایید  بلوک "if" را بیرون بکشیم و بلوک "turn left"
          را داخل آن قرار دهیم.
      5:
        image: notes/hoc4_5.jpg
        text: حالا، اگر ما بلوک "move forward" را بالای آن و بلوک "repeat" را اطراف
          همه چیز بگذاریم، هر زمان که آدم خور حرکت می کند، او بررسی می کند که اگر
          مسیری به چپ وجود داشته باشد، او می چرخد. استفاده از دستور "repeat" حیاتی
          است، به دلیل اینکه هر چرخش را در هر مرحله بررسی می کند.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc4_6.jpg
        text: بیانیه "if" در علم کامپیوتر واقعا مهم است. یکی از اولین برنامه هایی
          که من نوشته بودم بازی تیک-تک-تو بود، که در آن بیانیه "if" وجود داشت که می
          گفت، اگر فرد دیگری داره برنده می شود، جا را برایش ببند، که آنها برنده شوند.

        text: سلام, اسم من سلونی است. من از علم کامپیوتر برای کمک به حل مشکلات در
          بهداشت و پزشکی استفاده میکنم. بیاید در باره بلوک "if else"  یاد بگیریم.
          به نظر می رسد مانند بلوک "if" هست، اما یک بخش اضافی دارد قسمت پایانی دارد
          که به آن"else" گفته میشود.
      2:
        image: notes/hoc5_2.jpg
        text: اگریک بلوک "move forward" در جایی که می گوید "do" قرار دهم ویک بلوک
          "turn left" در جایی که می گوید "else", این یعنی زامبی بین 2 گزینه میتواند
          انتخاب کند. اگر مانعی درمسیر وجود دارد زامبی به جلو میرود و در غیر این صورت
          (مانعی در مسیر وجود ندارد) به چپ میچرخد.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc5_3.jpg
        text: Just like the "if" block, we can put "if else" blocks inside a "repeat"
          blocks so that the zombie keeps moving and the "if else" block will keep
          checking if there's somewhere to turn.

        text: An if-else statement is a decision between two things. Let's see how
          we can use an if-else statement with our buddy Scrat the squirrel.
      2:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat2.jpg
        text: This block looks the same as the "if" block, but there's an extra part
          at the bottom that says "else". If I put a "move forward" block where it
          says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else", that means Scrat
          the squirrel will move forward if there's a path ahead. If there's not a
          path ahead, Scrat will turn left.
      3:
        image: notes/saloni_ifelse_scrat3.jpg
        text: It's making a decision and doing one of the two actions based on that
          decision. And just like "if" blocks, you can put "if-else" blocks inside
          "repeat" blocks.

          آن کد را بنویسی، می‌توانی فقط از یک بلوک استفاده کنی.
      2:
        image: notes/stage13_2.jpg
        text: حالا می‌خواهیم یاد بگیریم که چطور توابع را تعریف کنیم. توابع تعریف شده

          programming is usually in text, but we'll use Blockly, which uses visual
          blocks that you can drag and drop to write programs. This is how even university
          students learn the basics. Under the hood, you're still creating code.

          "Move Forward" block.
      8:
        image: notes/frozen1_8.jpg
        text: Here, the "Move Forward" block says, "move forward by 100 pixels." When
          we press "Run", what happens? Elsa moves forward a certain amount on the
          screen, 100 pixels in fact! Pixels are basically very tiny squares on your
          computer screen.
      9:
        image: notes/frozen1_9.jpg
        text: The other block we have in this puzzle says "turn right by 90 degrees."
          And when we use this "Turn Right" block, that makes Elsa turn a certain
          amount. You can play around with how far you want Elsa to turn. The angle
          is measured from the path ahead of Elsa. So, this is a 90 degree turn. And
          this is a 120 degree turn.

          "Turn Right by 90 degrees" once, and then tell it to repeat this pair of
          actions 4 times. To do that, you need to put the "Move Forward" and "Turn
          Right" block inside a "Repeat" block.

          heads are better than one. In pair programming you and your partner are
          going to sit down together at one computer and you are both going to work
          on the same project.

          the navigator, just like driving a car. The driver sits at the computer
          and is the one using the keyboard and mouse or touchscreen and controlling
          the main actions of the computer. The other person is the navigator. The
          navigator helps the driver by answering the driver's questions and pointing
          out potential problems or mistakes.

          driver. You and your partner should always be talking. The driver can explain
          what she or he is doing. And the navigator can help suggest what to do next.

          algorithms. Algorithms are specific instructions that explain the order
          in which to do something. Even everyday things like eating breakfast or
          brushing your teeth are algorithms that require small steps to get a job
          done.

        text: Computers can be really smart but they can only understand you if you
          tell them exactly what you want step by step. The great thing about algorithms
          is that if you follow the instructions in order, you can do something that
          you didn't know how to do ahead of time. It's like following a recipe.

          recipes or algorithms depending on how we want the chocolate to taste. Each
          step is important, even the small ones, so that without one step, the rest
          of them cannot be completed. Creating algorithms that others can understand
          is really important. That's why each step has to be written down so that
          no matter who does it, the result is the same.

          each time to the pig or you can just tell the computer to move forward once,

        text: If you're writing an algorithm for a computer, you have to break it
          down to little tiny steps. So finish this row and go to the next, then the
          next one, and you'll be done.

          to make the bowl. Algorithms give you a road map for getting something done.

          out the repeat block and put the moveforward and turn right blocks inside
          the repeat block. When we hit run, the artist will repeat those steps four
          times to complete the square.

        text: A loop is a repetition of activity. Going into a hive to inspect, I
          look at a frame, and then I put it back. I repeat that same activity multiple
          times. It's looping around, doing the same activity multiple times.
      2:
        image: notes/C2_bee_loops_2.png
        text: This is the repeat block. Whatever you put inside the repeat block will
          repeat those actions the number of times that you tell it to. For example,
          in this level, rather than drag out move forward and get nectar three times,
          we're going to just drag them out once each and repeat the action three
          times. That made it easy!

        text: Usually programming is all in text but we'll use Blockly which uses
          visual blocks that you drag and drop to write programs. Under the hood,
          you're still creating code. To start off, we're going to build code for
          a program that will help this Angry Bird move through a maze to get to the
          evil pigs that stole its eggs.

        text: Blockly is split into three main parts. On the left is the bird's maze,
          where your program will run. The instructions for each level are written
          below the maze. This middle area is the toolbox and each of these blocks
          is a command that the bird can understand. The white space on the right
          is called the workspace and this is where we'll build our program.

          The bird moves forward one box on the grid. And what if I want the bird
          to do something after it moves forward one box? I can add another block
          to our program.

        text: I'm going to choose the "turn right" block and I'll drag it under my
          move block until the yellow arrow appears. Then I'll drop it and the two
          blocks will snap together. When I press "Run" again,  the bird will perform
          the commands that are stacked from top to bottom on our work space.

          drag it to the trash can. After you've hit run, you can always hit the reset
          button to get the bird back to the start. Now let's get those pigs!

          But first, we need to break this big project into easy to follow small steps.
          For making a paper airplane, we need to decide what steps to take and in
          what order to take them.

        text: You'll create your algorithm by first cutting apart the pictures. Next,
          you'll select the 6 pictures that show the steps needed to make a paper
          airplane and arrange those pictures in the correct order. After you have
          everything in order, you will trade algorithms with another student team
          to test out the algorithm to see if the algorithm works. A well designed
          algorithm is super important to making the best paper airplane.

        text: When we want to make chocolate, there are many big steps to that process.
          And each of those big steps has its own set of smaller steps. And there
          are different recipes, or algorithms, depending on how we want the chocolate
          to taste. Each step is important, even the small ones. So without one step,
          the rest of them cannot be completed. Creating algorithms that others can
          understand is really important. That's why each step has to be written down,
          so no matter who does it, the result is the same.

        text: One thing that computers are really good at is repeating commands. As
          a person, you'd get really bored if you had to do the same thing lots of
          times in a row. But a computer can do the same thing millions or even billions
          of times, and not get bored and be able to carry that out really well.

          by sending them an email, it might take me more than a century to actually
          write out all of those emails to everyone. But with just a few lines of
          code, I can have a system send an email to everyone on Facebook wishing
          them a happy birthday. So that's what loops are, and why they're valuable,
          and something that computers can do very well.

        text: In this example your goal is going to be to move the bird to get the
          pig.  Now we're gonna be able to use the "repeat" block in order to be able
          to do this very easily. You can either do this by giving the computer a
          "move forward" command five times in order to advance the bird one step
          each time to the pig.
      4:
        image: notes/C2_zuck_repeat_loop_4.png
        text: Or you can just tell the computer to "move forward" once, and then tell
          it to "repeat" that 5 times, and it will do the same thing. So in order
          to do this you drag your "move forward" command, and then you put it inside
          the "repeat" block.And you can click on it and tell it how many times you
          want to repeat the block to tell it how many steps you want it to take forward.
      5:
        image: notes/C2_zuck_repeat_loop_5.png
        text: Now one more thing is you can put as many commands as you want inside
          the "repeat" block. So in this example you're telling it to move forward
          and turn left, which it will do five times. All right good job and have
          fun!
