        title: Ievads datorzinātnēs
        desc: Šī nodarbība iepazīstinās Jūs ar datorzinātnes jēdzienu un izskaidros
          ar ko nodarbojas datorspeciālisti. Tā arī sniegs izglītojamajam iespēju
          uzņemties datorspeciālista lomu. Pēc dalības šajā nodarbībā, katrs izglītojamais
          paturēs atmiņā to, ko viņš būs iemācījies. Jums var rasties kārdinājums
          izlaist terminu apgūšanu mazākiem bērniem, bet pasniegt tos jautrā un rotaļīgā
          gaisotnē ir labāk nekā atlikt to uz vēlāku laiku.

        title: Algoritmiska domāšana
        desc: Ar vienīgi papīru un zīmuli skolēni četros solos apgūs algoritmisku
          domāšanu. Pēc īsa ievada skolēnus būtu jāsadala grupās, kurās tiem būs jāizstrādā
          instrukcija citiem skolēniem, kā uzzīmēt briesmonīti (no iepriekš izvēlēto
          briesmonīšu kataloga). Uzdevumam ir jāveic dekompozīcija, tad komandas analizēs
          visus briesmonīšus katalogā un noskaidros to raksturiezīmes, nodalīs dažādas
          briesmonīšu detaļas, un tad izmantos šo informāciju, lai izstrādātu algoritmu
          (norādes) citai komandai, kas zīmēs noteiktu briesmonīti. Komandas tad apmainīsies
          ar algoritmiem un mēģinās restaurēt šo briesmonīti izmantojot tikai algoritmu,
          zīmuli un papīru. Vai gala zīmējums atbilst tam, ko sākotnējā komanda iedomājās?

          īsti nozīmē programmēšana. Nodarība sāksies ar to, ka skolēni viens otram
          dos norādes izkrāsot kvadrātiņus uz milimetru papīra cenšoties atdarināt
          esošu zīmējumu. Ja pietiks laiks, tad nodarbība var noslēgties ar skolēnu
          izstrādātiem zīmējumiem.

        title: Algoritmi
        desc: This lesson covers algorithms.  Using tangram shapes and graph paper,
          the first exercise will show how important it is to make each instruction
          as clear and unambiguous as possible.  Afterward, the class will explore
          how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods
          can take more or fewer folds than others.

        title: Funkcijas
        desc: In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads,
          and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps,
          then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several
          times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program
          and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single
          sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class,
          whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for
          this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific
          materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use
          of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

        title: Dziesmas rakstīšana
        desc: Reading lyrics is a pretty intuitive venture for most students.  We'll
          take an activity that's already common knowledge and shift it into a solid
          education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar
          with the define/call process, we will add the extra capabilities that come
          along with passing parameters within those function calls.

          information, distinguishing what is safe and unsafe to share online.
      TangramAlgorithms:
        title: Tangram Algorithms
        desc: This lesson shows us something important about algorithms. If you keep
          an algorithm simple there are lots of ways to use it. If you want to make
          sure everyone ends up with the same thing, then your algorithm needs more
          detail.
      EnvelopeVariables:
        title: Envelope Variables
        desc: Variables allow for a lot of freedom in computer science.  This lesson
          helps to explain what variables are and how we can use them in many different
          ways. Use this activity before (or in conjunction with) the lesson on abstraction
          to really hit the idea home.
      MadGlibs:
        title: Mad Glibs
        desc: Abstraction is one of the most important skills for a computer scientist
          to understand.  This activity will have your students analyzing stories
          for differences so that they can abstract them away. Those abstracted stories
          become templates for fun and crazy new ones.
      ForLoopFun:
        title: For Loop Fun
        desc: We know that loops allow us to do things over and over again, but now
          we’re going to learn how to use loops with extra structure built right in.
      SongwritingWithParameters:
        title: Songwriting With Parameters
        desc: 'One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world
          is the function.  Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs
          that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program. This lesson
          will help students intuitively understand why combining chunks of code into
          functions is such a helpful practice.  '
      BinaryImages:
        title: Binary Images
        desc: Though many people think of binary as strictly zeros and ones, our previous
          courses taught students that information can be represented in a variety
          of binary options.  This lesson takes that concept one step further as it
          illustrates how a computer can store even more complex information (such
          as images and colors) in binary, as well.
