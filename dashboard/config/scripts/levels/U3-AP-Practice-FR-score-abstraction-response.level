The abstraction must integrate mathematical and logical concepts. Explain how your abstraction helped manage the complexity of your program. \r\n<br>\r\n<i>(Must not exceed 200 words)</i>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAnd here is the student written response that goes with the code shown at right:\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 80%; margin: auto; background-color: #d9eff7; padding: 10px; font-family: monospace; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18pt; display: inline-block\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/732ea3633d67312724382facaa281955-image-1507928836621.png\" style=\"float: right; margin-right: 40px\">\r\n<strong>Student response:</strong><br>\r\n\r\nThe abstraction I have identified draws a heart in the program.  The whole program draws a picture with turtle graphics that says \"I [heart] CS\" where the [heart] is actually a drawing of a heart shape. Because I am using the parameterized versions of these turtle functions it helps manage the complexity of the code. Without the parameters the drawing is achieve-able but would require many many more lines of code.  For example: the command to <code>arcRight(220, 30)</code>  - which moves the turtle in a 220-degree arc with a 30-pixel radius - is possible to do with a long series of repeated <code>moveForward</code>, and <code>turnRight</code> commands, possibly hundreds. By using the <code>arcRight</code> command I encapsulate in one line what the code should be doing rather than having to reason about hundreds of lines of code.\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\r\n<br>\r\nUse the scoring guide (shown below) to determine if the student should be awarded the point for each of the two criteria about abstractions (row 7 and 8)\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/478c762d2ac876b8b830caabd62c1571-image-1507929333152.png)\r\n\r\n# You score it\r\nIn the response area below write the following:\r\n\r\nFor each row determine (1) if the point should be awarded and (2) justify your decision - why did you (or did you not) award the point. Cite the specific criteria in the scoring guide that was or wasn't met.",
