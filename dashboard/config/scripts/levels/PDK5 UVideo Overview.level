The lesson plans for each activity explain in depth what you need to know and have on hand to teach that lesson, but if you're looking for a quick overview, Kiki Prottsman, who is Executive Director for [Thinkersmith](http://thinkersmith.org/) who collaborated to create this curriculum, has produced videos that explain each one of the unplugged activities in Courses 1, 2, and 3. \n\n[View Course 1 unplugged activity teacher videos here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DhNKNdmOtqBgWyF5kmy2oPh0U-Zfv2G)\n\n[View Course 2 unplugged activity teacher videos here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DhNKNdmOtobJjiTYvpBDZ0xzhXRj11N)\n\n[View Course 3 unplugged activity teacher videos here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DhNKNdmOtpGJ79ZYYttiEmc-1Aq8hxm)\n\nThese teacher-facing videos are different from the videos that are presented to students while they go through the Code Studio courses. Check out this teacher-facing video on how to do an unplugged activity from Course 1:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/icVRxFr39AU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n"
