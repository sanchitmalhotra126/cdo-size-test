You can control size by specifing the number of pixels tall and wide an image is. Pixels is abbreviated to px.  For example to make all the images 100px wide you would use:\r\n\r\nimg {\r\n\twidth: 100px;\r\n}\r\n\r\nYou can also control the height of images. It is better to choose the size of either the width of images or the height. Setting both can distort the image.\r\n\r\n## Borders\r\nBorders are a common property for many elements including images.\r\nBorders consist of three properties: style, size and color.\r\n\r\nimg {\r\n      border-style: dashed;\r\n      border-width: 5px;\r\n      border-color: blue;\r\n}\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp\"> W3 Schools - Border Properties</a>\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Add a rule to style img elements\r\n* Use the rule to set the width of all images to 200 pixels\r\n* Add borders to the images\r\n* Then add a border by using three properties: border, border-size and border-color\r\n\r\nRemember you will have time to play with colors and borders on your own page.
