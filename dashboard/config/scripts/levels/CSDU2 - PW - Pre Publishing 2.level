Every page in a student’s site should be checked for correct use of these basic tags.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Page 3 lists the fundamental structure tags that students have seen. Every page in a student’s site should be checked for correct use of these fundamental tags.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Page 4 is where students have documented the bugs they’ve encountered in the past. Because these are known bugs, students should closely review their sites to ensure none of these bugs are present. Furthermore they should take this opportunity to document any new bugs that they’ve encountered.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Page 5 is the list of PII that was just created. This is the most critical step of the publishing review. Using this list students comb through their sites to ensure that all PII has either been removed. This doesn’t have to mean stripping all of the personal importance out of student sites, and can be as simple as cropping an image to remove faces or replacing your school’s name with “my school”.\r\n\r\nTeaching Tip\r\nWhile the focus of this lesson is on preparing students to publish their pages, technically they’ve been accessible all along, we just haven’t been sharing the URL with others. From this point forward students should always assume that changes they make to their websites can be seen by the world at large.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Once students have thoroughly reviewed their sites, and made any necessary changes, they’ll be given access to the Share button and encouraged to publish the URL to their websites to friends and family. Depending on the age of your students and their access to outside websites from school you may choose to have students submit URLs to be published collectively on a class or school page.",
