This is the view that students see when they login to their accounts. As a teacher on Code.org, the only difference you'll see from the student view is that you are able to view lesson plans and see the solutions for every puzzle. \n\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n<img align=\"left\" src=\"http://staging.code.org/images/teacher-dashboard/lesson-plans.png\" height=\"200\" width=\"250\" hspace=\"20\" vspace=\"20\">\n\n\n## Lesson Plans and Resources\n\nWhen you click the \"Lesson Plans and Resources\" tile, you'll access lessons plans, an implementation guide, handouts for students and teachers, standards alignment for K-5 courses, video FAQs and more.  \n\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n<img align=\"left\" src=\"http://staging.code.org/images/teacher-dashboard/help.png\" height=\"200\" width=\"250\" hspace=\"20\" vspace=\"20\">\n\n## Help and Community\n\nWhen you click the \"Help and Community\" tile, you'll be connected to a community of engaged educators using Code.org. You'll be able to post questions, respond to other teacher's posts, and read FAQs by Code.org staff. On this page, you'll also be able to directly contact Code.org with any questions you may have.   \n\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n<img align=\"left\" src=\"http://staging.code.org/images/teacher-dashboard/pd.png\" height=\"200\" width=\"250\" hspace=\"20\" vspace=\"20\">\n\n## Professional Development\n\nWhen you click the \"Professional Development\" tile, you can sign up for a Code.org K-5 workshop in your area (if you are a K-5 teacher in the U.S.) These workshops provide meaningful opportunities to connect with passionate educators in your local area.
