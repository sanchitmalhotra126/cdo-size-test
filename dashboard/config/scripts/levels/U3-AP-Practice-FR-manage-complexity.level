Most of the time that means identifying a function or procedure you wrote to help \"manage complexity\" in your program.\r\n\r\nHere is the actual prompt from the Create Performance Task:\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 70%; margin: auto; background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 10px; font-family: serif; font-size: 12pt\">\r\n\r\n<b>2d.</b> Capture and paste a program code segment that contains an abstraction you developed individually on your own (marked with a <b>rectangle</b>). This abstraction must integrate mathematical and logical concepts. Explain how your abstraction helped manage the complexity of your program.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(Must not exceed 200 words)</i>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nBelow is a segment of code from an \"under the sea\" program with a rectangle drawn around a portion of the code identifying an abstraction. Imagine that you wrote this and are composing an AP response about how this abstraction manages complexity.  (Note: ignore the requirement that the abstraction integrate \"mathematical and logical concepts\" for this practice response.  Just write about managing complexity).\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/d98fa58fce78eff86fd734f32e2960e4-image-1507913593511.png)\r\n\r\nExplain how the abstraction marked with the rectangle in the code above helps manage complexity of this program.",
