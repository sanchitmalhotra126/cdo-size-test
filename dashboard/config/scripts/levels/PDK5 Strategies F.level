Here are some examples:\n\n- Implement the \"Ask 3 and then me\" rule in your classroom, which is when students have to ask 3 classmates for help before they can ask the teacher that same question. This reduces the number of students that you have to answer individually and promotes peer learning.\n- Be calm yet persistent when problems arise (which they will) because your reaction sets the tone for students. If at the first sign of an issue, you proclaim \"I'm terrible at technology. I give up,\" your students will think it's okay to do that too. \n- Take pride in their programs. Show it off, put it to work, post it online. This is a big accomplishment for you and your students that should be celebrated.\n- Your students may not need you in the way you think they need you. You don't need to be the expert. Ask probing questions to a student (even if you don't know the answer to the questions). Or ask the class if anyone has the answer. Or say \"I don't know; let's figure this out together\"\n\n\n<div id=\"discourse-comments\" />\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
