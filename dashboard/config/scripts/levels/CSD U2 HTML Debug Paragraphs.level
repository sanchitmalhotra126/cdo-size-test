Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences. Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some space between that group of text and the next group of text.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**Why does HTML seem to work even when it's broken?**</summary>\r\nHTML is read by your web browser to generate web pages. Since people often make little mistakes when writing their web pages, browsers often make a best guess of what you intended to do. Sometimes different browsers even will make different guesses! The only way to ensure your code looks like you intend is make sure you're always using tags correctly.\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Debug: Fix the Broken Tags\r\n\r\nThis simple web page has some issues which are preventing the content from being displayed correctly. Identify and fix the issues. This practice is also called \"debugging\" your code.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Fix the broken code so that the web page displays correctly\r\n* Compare the problems you fixed with a neighbor",
