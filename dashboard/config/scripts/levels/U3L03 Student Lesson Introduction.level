Procedures/functions are a way of \"naming\" chunks of code, that you can call (execute) as many times as needed. Procedures/function are a form of computational abstraction. Abstractions allow us to simplify a process by ignoring the details. They allow us to think about code in larger, more logical segments.\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Write procedures and functions with names that describe what the function does in solving the problem.\n* Design a program requiring more than one function/procedure and more than one level of abstraction. \n\n\n# Resources\n* Worksheet: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IuRx8-WrIl3mOo8upbzvIZgsoCZxlooq5RXXi4GouP8\" target=\"_blank\">\n Procedure Design </a> \n* Rubric: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qTkcvKzcC3Zgji-ITd9mEranpIjIMX8UdKFpZOYPi0E\" target=\"_blank\">\n Procedure Design </a> \n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
