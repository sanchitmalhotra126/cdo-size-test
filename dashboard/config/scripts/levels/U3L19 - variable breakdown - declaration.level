In javascript we call this: **declaring a variable.**\n\nThe code is rather simple:\n<pre>\nvar foo;\n</pre>\n\nThat single line of code says: **\"Hey JavaScript! Allocate a piece of memory for me, and slap a label on it that says 'foo'\"**\n\n<table width=800>\n<tr>\n<td width=66%>\nThe classic way to visualize what this line of code does is to think of an empty box or container with the label 'foo' next to it.\n</td>\n<td>\n<img src=\"https://code.org/educate/csp/images/codeStudio/U3L19-declarefoo.png\">\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Next: Assigning a value...</a>\n\n\n\n"
