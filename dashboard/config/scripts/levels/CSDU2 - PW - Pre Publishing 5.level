This is the most critical step of the publishing review. Using this list students comb through their sites to ensure that all PII has either been removed. This doesn’t have to mean stripping all of the personal importance out of student sites, and can be as simple as cropping an image to remove faces or replacing your school’s name with “my school”.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 6: Once students have thoroughly reviewed their sites, and made any necessary changes, they’ll be given access to the Share button and encouraged to publish the URL to their websites to friends and family. Depending on the age of your students and their access to outside websites from school you may choose to have students submit URLs to be published collectively on a class or school page.",
