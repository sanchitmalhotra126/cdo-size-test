This protocol is 7 bits long and so can encode 128 different symbols, each corresponding to one of the binary numbers between 0 and 127. Originally the encoding was designed for older printers and so the codes associated with the numbers 0-31 were designated as \"control codes\" which instruct the printer to perform certain actions. These codes are now largely out of use. Codes 32-126, however, contain many of the most commonly used symbols you use on the internet, including the lowercase and capital letters, the numbers 0-9, and most commonly-used punctuation marks. Perhaps more remarkably, this printable character set is also used to represent all of the text formatting we use to add variety and emphasis to \"plain-text\" documents. The ability to represent formatting using only ASCII symbols is the result of cleverly designed protocols.\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Learn about the ASCII encoding scheme.\n* Invent a text formatting language\n* Design a protocol for sending formatted text.\n* Discover the challenges of encoding meta-information.\n\n# Resources\n\n* Activity Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zL5pzxXcK3s3Xq0yg1tXJMxShMABZk2hP8BhEMdc5Eo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Sending Formatted Text</a>\n* Rubric <a href= \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nHFEshJrvQ0q92YZ46i1HGnAm-bK8wwvVorPIDjEmFc/edit?usp=sharing\"target=\"_blank\">Sending Formatted Text</a>\n* Resource <a href= \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfc2M2t5D_93cz0axgvkwQao7fmYCFncS6Hi52ENnHE/edit?usp=sharing\"target=\"_blank\">Widget Diagram</a> \n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n",
