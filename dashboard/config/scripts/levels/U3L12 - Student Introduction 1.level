Sequential programs are predictable; they start at a beginning point and progress to the end point with occasional branches to control structures or functions. Event-driven programs do not progress in a predictable order. Events outside of the program, such as mouse clicks and key presses, control the asynchronous execution of the program and can create unique issues.\n\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Participate in an event-driven programming simulation using playing cards.\n* Examine the problems that can arise in event-driven programming.\n\n# Resources\n\n* Activity Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mcoLUM7mIQalnlrnm_MANVybvT4lbBR2My3kQmB1hrc/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Mission Unsortable</a>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
