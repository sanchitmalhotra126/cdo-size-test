Although you may put an `<h1>` element on your page content with the title of your website, the computer does not necessarily know that is the title as there may be multiple `<h1>` tags on your page.\r\n\r\nTo make clear what the title of a website is for the computer the `<title>` element is added as metadata in the `<head>` element.  This title is not displayed on the page anywhere as a result of the title tag but the browser may use it to put a name in the tab of your web browser or display it when someone searches for your website.\r\n\r\nTitles are important to search engines because titles are often a primary piece of information looked at by users to decide which websites fulfill their needs. \r\n\r\nEvery page on your website needs it own title.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n\t&lt;title&gt; My Website Title&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Guidelines for Creating Good Titles\r\n\r\nMake your titles:\r\n\r\n* descriptive\r\n* concise\r\n* try not to repeat titles across pages \r\n\r\n**Sometimes search engines will still generate their own title for your page based on the user search and what the algorithm of the search engine thinks is best for supporting what the user is looking for.**\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Add a `<title>` element to each web page inside the `<head>` element",
