Remember you can experiment with `<h1>` to `<h6>` to find the right size.\r\n* Under each hobby name, use a small size to write how long you’ve been participating in this hobby.\r\n* Write a few sentences below the time header which describes more about your interest and experience with the hobby. This one does not need to go in a tag.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n* 1 title with large header size\r\n* At least 3 medium headers with each Hobby Name\r\n* At leasat 3 small headers with the time you’ve been doing each hobby\r\n* At least a 2 to 3 sentence description of each hobby under the hobby’s time",
