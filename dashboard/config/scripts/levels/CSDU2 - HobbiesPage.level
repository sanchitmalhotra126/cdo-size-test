Remember you can experiment with &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; to find the right size.\r\n* Under each hobby name, use a small size to write how long you’ve been participating in this hobby.\r\n* Write a few sentences below the time header which describes more about your interest and experience with the hobby. This one does not need to go in a tag.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n* Title with Large Header Size \r\n* Medium Headers with each Hobby Name\r\n* Small Headers with the time you’ve been doing each hobby\r\n* 2-3 sentence description of each hobby under the hobby’s time",
