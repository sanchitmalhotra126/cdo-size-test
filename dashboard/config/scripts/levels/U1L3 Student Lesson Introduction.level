To send information we need to encode it in some way, or in other words turn it into something physical that the receiver could recognize. The information you sent with your devices was binary because it could only take one of two states. We call this type of information a bit, which is short for \"binary digit\". This means that last class you were using your devices to encode bits. This was pretty convenient, since the messages you were sending were also binary. Today, you will consider how to send information that may have more than two states that you want to communicate.\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Use your bit-sending device to send a message that has more than two possibilities. \n* Invented a system of communication that uses combinations of binary messages. \n* Use the term \"bit\" as another way to describe a binary message. \n\n\n# Resources\n\n* Activity Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FY6RjnY8P8cLd8CYwm8nNnvVqN2dFlww0kSi_LIMoDw/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Bit-sending Device</a>\n* Assessment: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N5lkggG807XKiu5kRLmBc1xm4ELQLfEoQhrLUKb59bw/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Bit-sending Device Rubric</a>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n\n\n"
