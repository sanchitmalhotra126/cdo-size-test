A bit sending device can be used to send any kind of message, as long as the message is binary and a communication protocol has been established. Bits can be grouped together to send more complex messages.\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Use your bit-sending device to send a message that has more than two possibilities. \n* Invented a system of communication that uses combinations of binary messages. \n* Use the term \"bit\" as another way to describe a binary message. \n\n\n# Resources\n\n* Activity Guide: [Bit-sending Device](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FY6RjnY8P8cLd8CYwm8nNnvVqN2dFlww0kSi_LIMoDw/edit?usp=sharing)\n* Assessment: [Bit-sending Device Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N5lkggG807XKiu5kRLmBc1xm4ELQLfEoQhrLUKb59bw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n",
