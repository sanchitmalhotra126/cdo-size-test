You are going to use buttons to switch between screens.\r\n\r\nGo to Design Mode and add a button to each of the screens.  Make sure to give them IDs which make it easy to tell the difference.\r\n\r\nOn the Black Screen the button should saw 'Go to White'.\r\nOn the White Screen the button should saw 'Go to Black'\r\n\r\nUse Design Mode to get the event handlers for each of your buttons. \r\n\r\nNow check out the setScreen block. You can use that in your event handlers to set the screen. \r\n\r\nTest out your app to make sure you can switch back and forth between the two screens.",
