This is a very power technique and one that you will use a lot.  \n\nIn this example we use setText in combination with a button press so you can see the effect.  This example is mostly about using setText as an output technique more than it is about variables.  Notice the call to setText in the button event handler.\n\n<pre>\nbutton(\"myButton\",\"Click me to see label change\");\ntextLabel(\"myLabel\", \"Here is some original text\");\nvar foo = 17;\n\nonEvent(\"myButton\", \"click\", function(){\n   setText(\"myLabel\", \"Foo is: \" + foo);\n});\n</pre>\n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Try it on the next page</a>\n\n\n\n"
