You should see the connection between the bit-sending devices and tools that you made and used in class and how bits are sent in the \"real world.\" Bits are actually sent using a variety of mediums - wires, radio waves, light - each of which has benefits and drawbacks. These different bit-sending devices all serve different people, groups, and organizations but can work together because they are all just sending bits. Depending on the situation, one is often a \"better\" choice than another.  \n\n# Objectives \nThe students will...\n\n* Research a technical subject matter in order to reason about and make connections to prior class activities\n* Communicate technical subject matter in their own words to classmates\n* Be able to describe how a bit is represented and transmitted on physical mediums used in the real Internet\n* Be able to describe how a bit might physically travel over a long distance and over a variety of interconnected mediums that comprise the modern Internet.\n\n# Possible Terminology\n\n* Bit rate\n* Bandwidth\n* Latency\n* Throughput\n\n\n# Resources\n* Video: [The Physical Internet](http://#)\n* Activity Guide: [Research & Presentation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1js03d0cgeLa0k05nufURz96Bb4py6tjtwavFYCV0c1U/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Assessment\n* [Research & Presentation Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ovLcsWFg7Oi-qm9bUV1ouS3jsDyII-C-reVCA-AbmE/edit?usp=sharing)\n"
