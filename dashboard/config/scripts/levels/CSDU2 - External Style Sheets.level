So far you have been separating style and content by using the `<style>` element and putting it inside the `<head>` element. You can get clearer separation by actually putting content and style in separate files. The new file for CSS will be called an **external style sheet**. Most of the time the file name will be **style.css**.\r\n\r\nSince the file ends in .css the web browswer already knows that this is CSS code so we no longer need the `<style>` element around it. \r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Add a new CSS file called style.css\r\n* Copy all the CSS from inside the `<style>` element from the .html file to the .css file\r\n* Delete the `<style>` element from the .html file",
