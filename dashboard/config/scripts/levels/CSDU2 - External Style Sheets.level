A better practice is to put all of the style rules into one place - called an external style sheet.\r\n\r\nIn this level you will move the style from “index.html” into an external style sheet so that it can be shared with “houses.html”\r\n\r\nUsing an external style sheets has three steps.\r\nCreate the sheet\r\nThis sheet should live in the same place as the index.html page - often called the root directory\r\nThe extension should be “.css”\r\nThe name can be anything, but generally is called “style.css”\r\nLink the sheet\r\nTo link sheets, a new element, &lt;link&gt; should be used. It has two main attributes\r\nhref - the file path and name of the style sheet \r\nrel - indicates the relationship that the linked file has to the current file, in this case its a stylesheet\r\nIn each HTML page, add a link child element to the page’s &lt;head&gt; element\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt; Odd Stuff Site&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\nWrite the rules on the sheet, they will apply to the elements on any linked HTML page\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nOpen the Mini Odd Starter Project, which just contains two of the site’s pages\r\nindex.html\r\nhouses.html\r\n Odd Stuff Starter Project\r\nUse the green plus button to add a new “CSS” file. \r\n\r\nThe file should be named “style.css” by default - if not, right click on the file to rename it.\r\nNotice that there is already a style rule for the body with two properties\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we need to apply that style rule to one of our pages, houses.html,  by adding a link element to that HTML page’s head.\r\n &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt; Crazy Houses &lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\nNotice how the style from “style.css” has been added to the house.html! Change the values of the font family and background color properties to any value that you like.\r\n",
