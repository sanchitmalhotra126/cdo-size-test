Using consistent styles on a page help to build a brand so it is a good idea to using some kind of consistent styling across all the pages on your site. In addition you learned previously how it is good to separate content and style (HTML and CSS code). We can get clearer separation by actually putting content and style in separate files. The new file for CSS will be called an external style sheet and the file will be of the form style.css.\r\n\r\nTo link sheets, a new element, &lt;link&gt; should be used. It has two main attributes\r\nhref - the file path and name of the style sheet \r\nrel - indicates the relationship that the linked file has to the current file, in this case its a stylesheet\r\nIn each HTML page, add a link child element to the page’s &lt;head&gt; element\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt; Odd Stuff Site&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\nWrite the rules on the sheet, they will apply to the elements on any linked HTML page\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Add a file called style.css (This is the general name used for many css files)\r\n* Copy the style code from the .html file to the .css file\r\n* Link the css file using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` element\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOdd Stuff Starter Project\r\nUse the green plus button to add a new “CSS” file. \r\n\r\nThe file should be named “style.css” by default - if not, right click on the file to rename it.\r\nNotice that there is already a style rule for the body with two properties\r\n\r\nNow we need to apply that style rule to one of our pages, houses.html,  by adding a link element to that HTML page’s head.\r\n &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt; Crazy Houses &lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\nNotice how the style from “style.css” has been added to the house.html! Change the values of the font family and background color properties to any value that you like.",
