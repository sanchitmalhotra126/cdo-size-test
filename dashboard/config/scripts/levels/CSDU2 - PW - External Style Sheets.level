Remember, if there is more than one rule for an element, the rule closest to bottom will dictate the style. Best practice is to only have one rule per element so decide on just one rule for each of your sites elements:\r\n\r\nHeaders\r\nLists\r\nParagraphs\r\nDiv\r\nBody\r\n\r\nIn order to determine how many rules you have to decide between, you can always use Ctrl+F to look for a selector.\r\n\r\nIn the example below, I see 4 rules for my body, so I know I have to delete 3 of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n* Create a CSS sheet and name it “style.css”\r\n* Cut/Paste the CSS code from inside each `<style>` element internal sheet to external sheet\r\n* Delete the `<style>` elements in each HTML document.\r\n* Link the stylesheet to each document in a project.\r\n\r\nIn the next level you can add classes to style elements separately.",
