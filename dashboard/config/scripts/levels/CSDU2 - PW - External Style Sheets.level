Remember, if there is more than one rule for an element, the rule closest to bottom will dictate the style. Best practice is to only have one rule per element so decide on just one rule for each of your sites elements:\r\n\r\nHeaders\r\nLists\r\nParagraphs\r\nDiv\r\nBody\r\n\r\nIn order to determine how many rules you have to decide between, you can always use Ctrl+F to look for a selector.\r\n\r\nIn the example below, I see 4 rules for my body, so I know I have to delete 3 of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\nIn this project, create a CSS sheet and name it “style.css”\r\nLink the stylesheet to each document in a project\r\nCut/Paste the style element from internal sheet to external sheet\r\nDon’t forget to delete the opening and closing “style” tags.\r\nUse Ctrl+F to search for selector tags and ensure you have one rule per element\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the next level we can add classes to style elements separately.
