    "markdown": "## CSP PD Phases\n\nThese features described on the previous level run through each phase of the PD experience, which are described below: \n\n### Phase 1: Online Introduction\n**Overview:** The first phase of professional development is a two-hour online introduction that focuses on providing a foundational knowledge of the Code.org program and CSP course resources. It creates a space for participants to become familiar with the curriculum, the platform, and the tools that will be used in the course.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to see participant takeaways for phase 1</summary>\n<ul><li> I have created my Code Studio teacher account.</li>\n<li> I know about Code.org's CSP course.</li>\n<li> I am familiar with the Code.org PD tools. </li>\n<li> I am excited to go to Phase 2!</li> </ul>\n</details>\n\n### Phase 2: Blended Summer Study\n**Overview:** The second phase of professional development is a blended in-person and follow-up online experience. \n\n* **In-person workshop:** This 5-day workshop is the primary opportunity for development prior to the first year of instruction. Participants will explore curriculum, tools, classroom management, and teaching strategies. You will dive into the College Board requirements that come with an AP course and build a local community of teachers who are using this curriculum. Spending practical time working with the curriculum, you will develop an understanding of how to effectively use the materials and pedagogical strategies that are part of any strong computer science classroom.\n\n* **Online follow-up:** This 8-hour online experience provides space to plan the beginning of the academic year. Teachers will dive deeper into the curriculum, interacting with tools and widgets that students will use in the class. Additionally, the online work includes collaborating with other teachers in a professional online learning community--- an important teacher tool during the first-year of teaching this course.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to see participant takeaways for phase 2</summary>\n<ul><li>I know how to use the provided online tools, resources, and supports I need to teach this class.\n</li>\n<li>I have thought about and discussed how the Code.org materials will work in the classroom and am ready for the first week.\n</li>\n<li>I am part of a professional learning community of teachers.</li>\n<li>I understand the educational philosophy behind the tools and curriculum, and I'm confident I can teach this course.</li> \n<li>I am learning how to teach CS in a way that broadens participation.</li>\n<li>I have thought about and discussed the things to look out for in the CS classroom (equity issues, etc).</li>\n<li>I understand the AP pieces of the course and feel that I will be able to help my students with them.</li> </ul>\n</details>\n\n### Phase 3: Academic Year Development\n**Overview:** The third phase of professional development is composed of blended ongoing quarterly in-person meetings and online activities.\n\n* **In-person workshops:** These quarterly meetings will continue to build pedagogical strategies and explore the essential elements of this course. You will participate in activities such as using the AP performance tasks in your course, teaching new content, and keeping the classroom environment equitable and engaging for all students.\n* **Online activities:** These online activities are focused on building the online professional learning community. They provide continued support with tools, content, and helpful resources allowing further exploration of the curriculum.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to see participant takeaways for phase 3</summary>\n<ul><li> My professional learning community is a good place for me to turn for support, both in and out of PD. </li>\n<li> I have a better idea of the curriculum, because I've had a chance to explore it more deeply in person with my professional learning community.</li>\n<li> I have even more ideas about leading an engaging and equitable CSP classroom.</li>\n<li> I have ideas for recruiting diverse students for next year.</li></ul>\n</details>\n\n### Phase 4: Summer Wrap-up\n**Overview:** The fourth phase of professional development is an in-person workshop focused on diving deeper into content and material that was difficult to teach the first time and empowering teachers to take ownership of the curriculum by making adjustments and changes in order to meet their students' needs. The fourth phase addresses curricular materials with an eye for teaching and learning in context. Teachers will reflect on what success looks like in an AP course and how to recruit diverse groups of students.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to see participant takeaways for phase 4</summary>\n<ul><li>I look forward to teaching the course again based on my reflection of the past year.</li>\n<li>I am confident in supporting my students through all of the AP assessments.</li>\n<li>I am more comfortable with the material that I struggled with the first time teaching this course.</li>\n<li>I understand how to make changes to the Code.org curriculum in order to meet my students' needs and fit into my local context.</li></ul>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
