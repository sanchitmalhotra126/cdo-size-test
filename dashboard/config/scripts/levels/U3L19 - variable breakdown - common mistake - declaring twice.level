You can just refer to it by its name.\n\nSo, let's say you wanted to create a variable called 'foo' with the value 7 and then later change it to 17.  This code is considered bad form...\n\n<pre>\nvar foo = 7;\nvar foo = 17;\n</pre>\n\nThe correct way to do this would be:\n\n<pre>\nvar foo = 7;\nfoo = 17;\n</pre>\n\nI know, I know, it's tempting to want to type <span style=\"font-family: monospace\">var foo</span> the second time because you want to tell the computer, \"Hey, I want to use the *variable foo*.\"    But you don't have to. As we saw earlier, once the variable is made, you can just refer to it by its name.\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Next: new ways to read the value inside a variable</a>\n\n\n"
