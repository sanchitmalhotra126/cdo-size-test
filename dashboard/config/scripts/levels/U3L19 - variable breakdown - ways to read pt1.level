Other times you might just need to inspect it while you're writing your code to make sure its value is what you think it should be. \n\nHere are 3 common ways to see the value of your variables.\n\n**Write it to the screen**\n<pre>\nvar foo = 7;\nwrite(foo);\n</pre>\nWe've been using this one in this lesson already.  Useful for a quick, visual way to see a value of a variable immediately.\n\n\n**Write it to the console**\n\n<pre>\nvar foo = 7;\nconsole.log(foo);\n</pre>\nThis one is new.  Similar to write, it's also a quick way to see a variable's value, but has the benefit of not showing up on the screen. This is useful for debugging problems when they come up. The user will never see this output. So you can stick console.log statements in your code as a way to sanity check what's going on.\n\nLet's try this one...\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Practice with console.log</a>\n\n\n"
