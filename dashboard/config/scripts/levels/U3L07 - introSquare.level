A `for` command is followed by curly braces `{ }` . Just like a function definition the commands that are placed within those curly braces are a part of the loop. There is a single opening in the `for` block that allows you to choose how many times in a row you'd like to repeat these commands. We call each repeat of the commands a single **iteration**.\r\n\r\n**Read the documentation: ** You'll want to read the documentation for this block, especially if you're curious about the rest of the syntax you'll see included `for(var i = 0; i < 4; i++)` . In time you will understand everything happening in that command, but for now it is fine to mentally treat it as a \"repeat\" block with a single opening to indicate the number of repetitions.\r\n\r\n**Draw a square: ** To make things simple start by drawing a single square using the `for` block. You should be able to do it much more efficiently than the 8 commands it would've required you to write previously.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/5dfab9a3df4dc0df8a858655933eb9ad-image-1442374182752.29.32 PM.png)",
