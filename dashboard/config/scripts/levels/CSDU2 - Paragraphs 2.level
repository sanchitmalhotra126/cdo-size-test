Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences. All of your text in your web page should be contained in an HTML element (headers or paragraphs). Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some space between that group of text and the next group of text.\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>**How do I create multiple paragraphs?**</summary>\r\nParagraphs are marked by opening(`<p>`) and closing(`</p>`) tags as well. To create more than one paragraph you will want multiple sets of opening and closing `<p>` tags. For example\r\n<pre>\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;\r\n    \tThis is a paragraph.\r\n    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;\r\n    \tThis is another paragraph.\r\n    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n</details>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Paragraphs\r\n\r\nNow that you have a header try to separate the two sentences like the example below using the paragraph element.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.code.org/12f8d4230fcd2144a5880815c8375149-image-1480364278934.12.18 PM.png\" style=\"width:300px\">",
