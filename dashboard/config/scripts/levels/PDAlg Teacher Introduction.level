The first step to building that community is getting to know one another. Tell us all a little bit about yourself - where do you teach, why are you interested in Computer Science, and what are you like outside of the classroom. Once you've posted your introduction, please take a moment to read through and comment on everyone else's intros.\n\n<div id=\"discourse-comments\" />\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
