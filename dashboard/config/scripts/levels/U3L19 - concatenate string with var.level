Here we **concatenate** a string with the value of foo.\n\n<pre>\nvar foo;\nfoo = 7;\nwrite(\"The value of foo is: \"+foo);\n</pre>\n\n**REMEMBER:** 'Concatenate' is just a fancy word that means to link things together in a chain.\n\nIn JavaScript the + sign can actually do math as you would expect.  We'll see that in a bit.  But when you try to \"add\" a string together with a variable, JavaScript assumes that your are trying to link things together in one string.\n\nHere's an example of stringing together a few things.\n\n<pre>\nvar numLikes = 7:\nwrite(\"So far \" + numLikes + \" like this page\");\n</pre>\n\nOn the next screen we'll have you play with this a little bit.\n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Try it...</a>\n\n\n"
