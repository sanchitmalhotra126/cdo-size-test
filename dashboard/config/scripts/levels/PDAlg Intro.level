This online course is intended to be used in conjunction with our three phase professional development model, which includes a multi-day Summer workshop and mid-year check-ins. To ensure that you are prepared for each stage of PD, please complete the online units in the order presented and during the appropriate timeframe.\n\nDuring this online course, you'll watch videos, read articles, do online activities, and discuss with other teachers the intersection of Algebra and computer science. We want you to get excited to teach computer science, expose you to writing computer programs like your students will write, and let you explore writing computer programs on your own.\n\nIf you have any questions during PD you can get support by emailing [pd@code.org](mailto:pd@code.org).\n\n<br>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
