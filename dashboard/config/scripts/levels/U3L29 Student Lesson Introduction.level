Such statistical analysis of data is easier when done digitally with the use of loops and counters.\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Calculate statistics from a coin flipping experiment\n.\n* Create an application to repeat the experiment 10,000 times. \n\n\n# Resources\n* Activity: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/lsoc.org/document/d/16CdQWtS_JtyiQAFcxFeRc0LeB1lwL-ak9hIE9ehn3gY\" target=\"_blank\">\nFlipping Coins\n</a>\n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
