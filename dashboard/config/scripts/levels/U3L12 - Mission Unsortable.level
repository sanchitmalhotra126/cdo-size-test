There are 4 missions:\n\n* Mission 1: The Swapper\n* Mission 2: The Turn Downer\n* Mission 3: The Timer and Flipper-Upper\n* Mission 4: The Card Exchanger\n\nEach Mission has a sheet that explains your mission and how to act it out.\nAsk your teacher for your mission sheet\n\n# Resources\n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
