Built on the tested techniques and pedagogy of [Bootstrap](http://bootstrapworld.org), CS in Algebra is a new take on using functional programming to teach Algebra. Through this online PD you'll be introduced to the new visual programming language we've developed, and you'll see how you can apply everything you've learned teaching Bootstrap into this new curriculum as well.\n\n### What's Different?\n\nIn developing this course we've taken everything we've learned about computer scaffolded instruction and visual programming and merged it with the curriculum and pedagogy of Bootstrap. You'll find the main differences are:\n\n| Feature | Bootstrap | CS in Algebra |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Programming Language | Text (Racket) | Visual (Evaluation Blocks) |\n| Learning Environment | [WeScheme](http://wescheme.org) | [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org) |\n| Instructional Supports | Lesson Plans<br>Student Workbook | [Lesson Plans](http://code.org/curriculum/algebra)<br>Student Workbook<br>[Scaffolded Activities](http://studio.code.org/s/algebra)<br>Student-facing Videos |\n| Student Accounts | Google login (email required) | Code.org Accounts (no email required)<br>[Teacher Dashboard](http://code.org/teacher-dashboard)|\n\n### What's the Same?\nJust about everything else that you've come to love about Bootstrap has been brought along to CS in Algebra. The scope and sequence, Design Recipe, projects, and overall video game are all present, with some new fun surprises as well.\n\n### What do you love about Bootstrap?\nPost your favorite element of the Bootstrap curriculum to this forum. Come back later to read the posts of others and further the conversation.\n\n<div id=\"discourse-comments\" />\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
