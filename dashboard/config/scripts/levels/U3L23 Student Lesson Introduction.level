It is technology that allows programs, called chatbots, such as Siri to recognize your voice and respond \"intelligently\". Some look for keywords and respond with pre-fabricated sentences. More sophisticated chatbots analyze the parts of speech and the meaning of words.\n\n# Lesson\n\n* Interact with a variety of chatbots.\n* Speculate on elements in the algorithms for chatbots. \n* Analyze the purpose, features, and interface of a chatbot. \n\n\n\n# Resources\n* Activity: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13dG_S8Qi8sMoWUbCdpNa8CtrzLGoWlk-BbrAPRnwEYk\" target=\"_blank\">Chatbot Analysis \n</a>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n"
