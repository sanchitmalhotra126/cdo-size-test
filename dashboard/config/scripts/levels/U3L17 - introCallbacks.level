In order to address this issue the data commands include **an optional third parameter** called a **callback function**. A callback function is a function which will run only after you've received confirmation from the server that it has received a request. Commands that should run after you've received confirmation from a server **must go in the callback function**.\r\n\r\n![](https://images.code.org/5df603c069fbe2011d2825f0f749f498-image-1445363715944.51.54 PM.png)\r\n\r\nThe program you are about to see contains two `setKeyValue` commands which update the same key value pair, called `predictableBit`. This time, however, we have used **callback functions** to sequence the `setKeyValue` commands. Since the second call to `setKeyValue` is in the callback function of the first it will only run after the server has confirmed that it received the first request. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* **Run the program** and check the **Data Viewer** to see what value `predictableBit` was set to\r\n* **Repeat the experiment** to confirm the `setKeyValue` commands are now arriving in the correct order.\r\n* **Alter the program** so that instead of always setting `predictableBit` to **0 and then 1** it always sets it to **1 and then 0**. You will need to use **callback functions**",
