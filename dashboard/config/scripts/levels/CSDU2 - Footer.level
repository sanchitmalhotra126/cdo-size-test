You have already practiced doing this for the header of the web page using the `<div>` element. Since you now know how to differentiate between elements of the same type using class we can add more `<div>` elements.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n* Find the current `<div>` element on each page and put it in the \"header\" class\r\n* Change the current style rule for `<div>` element to style elements in the header class instead.\r\n* Move all content on the home page that is not in the header div into a separate div element\r\n* Move all content on the technology page that is not in the header div into a separate div element\r\n* Add the new `<div>` element on each page to the \"content\" class\r\n* Add styling for the content class.
