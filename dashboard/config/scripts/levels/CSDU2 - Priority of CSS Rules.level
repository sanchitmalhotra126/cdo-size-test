The second paragraph selector rule overwrites the first one.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s say we wanted the h1, Crazy Houses to be red\r\nAdd the following style rule to style.css\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nh1{\r\n  color: red\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nNow there are two rules for all headers on this site, one turns them red and the other turns them dodger blue. Since the rule to turn them red is after the dodger-blue rule, the red style gets applied.",
