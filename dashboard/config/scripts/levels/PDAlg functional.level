Some of the defining characteristics of this language are:\n\n- Variables are immutable (once a value has been defined, it cannot be changed)\n- Functions do not have side effects (given the same inputs, a function will run the same way every time, because it can't be impacted by outside elements)\n- Every function maps its inputs (domain) to its output (range)\n",
