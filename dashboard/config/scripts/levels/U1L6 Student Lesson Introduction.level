The \"binary number system\" that is so fundamental to computing is a logical way of representing numbers with values that have two possible states. Representing values using a finite set of patterns in predictable sequences is the basis of a number system.\n\n\n# Lesson\n* Count using circles, triangles, and squares.\n* Create a number systems with non-numeric symbols. \n* Write the rules for counting with your number system.\n\n\n# Resources\n\n* Activity Guide: [Counting with Shapes](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/document/d/1QX6PDWnNHIJdE3aNMrXIBmlTSyL_jiWdu-OELV0rWvA/edit)\n* Widget: [Odometer Widget](http://cspdashboard-c9-bfranke.c9.io/Odometers/)\n* Peter Denning [Computation\n: A new way of science](http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/GP/overviews/ov_computation.pdf)\n\n\n",
