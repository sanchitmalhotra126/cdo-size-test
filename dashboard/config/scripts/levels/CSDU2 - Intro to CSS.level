This is done by selecting certain elements of HTML and applying certain style properties to them in style rules.\r\n\r\nStyle rules consists of three parts:the selector, the property and the property’s value.\r\n\r\nSelector - the html element to be styled\r\nProperty - describes which style component of the selected element to change\r\nValue - describes what to change the property to\r\n\r\nTo add CSS style rules to an HTML page, add a &lt;style&gt; element as a child of &lt;head&gt;.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  &lt;style&gt;\r\n    h1{\r\n      color:blue;\r\n    }\r\n  &lt;/style&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe above code will make all h1 headers on the page blue. The “color” property is a property for any text elements including paragraphs, lists and headers. There are hundreds of CSS properties that help add style to HTML elements. Not all properties can be used for all elements. \r\n\r\n# Do This\r\nThere is already a &lt;style&gt; element added inside the &lt;head&gt; element. There is also a style rule which is making all h1 headers blue.\r\n\r\n* Change the style rule for h1 headers so the text is green.\r\n* Add another rule that defines the color of h3 headers. Web Lab provides you a list of colors as you type. Pick your favorite.",
