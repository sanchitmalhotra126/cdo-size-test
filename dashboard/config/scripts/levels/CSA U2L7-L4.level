Pass `\"Katie\"` as the owner and `strawberryShortcake` as the `newDessert` to the `FoodTruck` constructor. Both `Dessert` and `Cake` objects can be passed as the `newDessert` argument of the `FoodTruck` constructor because `Cake` inherits from `Dessert`. `Cake` is a `Dessert`!\r\n\r\n3. `Cake` objects can be stored in variables of type `Dessert` too! Change the type of the variable `strawberryShortcake` from `Cake` to `Dessert` and rerun your code.",
