Aborting validation.\r\n* Start tag seen without seeing a doctype first. Expected e.g. <!DOCTYPE html>.\r\n\r\nAll of these error messages point out that a computer trying to read your document hasn't been alerted that you are in fact using html. In order to let the computer science that this is an html document you need to do two things:\r\n\r\n1. Add &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; at the very top of your html file. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is always the first thing in an html document because it notifies the computer that this is an html document and to interpret it as such. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is not technically a tag but instead an instruction to the web browser. \r\n\r\n2. Wrap all the content of the file in an HTML element using the &lt;html&gt; tag. The &lt;html&gt; tag notifies the computer where the html starts and ends. The  &lt;html&gt; tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag).  So you need an opening and closing &lt;html&gt; tag.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Add &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; at the top of your index.html file\r\n* Add &lt;html&gt; right underneath &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; and add a closing &lt;/html&gt; tag at the end of index.html\r\n\r\nOnce you have done this return to the <a href=\"https://studio.code.org/s/csd2/stage/5/puzzle/3\">validator level</a>",
