Each row, or stage, is a lesson. Some stages are unplugged lessons, which are lessons that you will lead for your classrooms without the use of computers. There are student-facing videos for these lessons and also student assessments they can complete after the activity.\n\nThe online stages are the rows with many numbered circles on them. Each circle represents a puzzle where a student has to write a computer program to complete the goal of the puzzle. In these lessons, students can work at their own pace to complete all the puzzles in a stage, in order. There are tutorial videos and hints along the way that will help them complete these challenges.\n\nEach lesson comes with a lesson plan that is available when you click \"View lesson plan\" under the name of each lesson. Below is an image of what Course 1 looks like in Code Studio. \n\n</br>\n\n![image](http://staging.code.org/images/course1stagemap.png)\n\n</br>\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n\n"
