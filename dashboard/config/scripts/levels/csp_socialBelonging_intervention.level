The video highlights that **anyone can learn computer science.** It really does not matter how much or little experience you have with computer science already, or what age, gender, or skin color you have -- everyone can learn computer science and make a difference!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Quotes from students\r\n\r\nStill, we understand that it can be daunting at first to take a computer science course. So here are a few student quotes describing their experiences. Please read them carefully. \r\n\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #586771;  background-image: url('https://images.code.org/8cd67816b927da988526a7bc81896b45-image-1501013902969.png'); background-repeat: no-repeat; border-radius: 20px; color: white; width: 55%; margin-left: 0%; padding:30px;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 125%; line-height: 1.5; margin-top: 40px\">\r\n\"At the start of the class I worried that I was different from the other students. I wasn't sure I fit in – I worried that I couldn’t do it and that the teacher and other students would look down on me. Some days after I started, I realized that almost everyone who takes the class isn’t sure if they fit in at first. It's something everyone goes through. Now it seems ironic – everybody feels different at first, when really we're all going through the same thing.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 125%;\">\r\n\r\n-- Sofia P.

I had the wrong picture in my head about CS, it’s actually very creative!
