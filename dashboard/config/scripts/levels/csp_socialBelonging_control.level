The video highlights that **anyone can learn computer science.** It really does not matter how much or little experience you have with computer science already, or what age, gender, or skin color you have -- everyone can learn computer science and make a difference!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Quotes from students\r\n\r\nStill, taking a computer science course can be difficult at first.
