    "markdown": "## ECS PD Overview\n\nThe Code.org PD program supports teachers with diverse teaching backgrounds. Whether you are new to teaching computer science (CS) or you have CS teaching experience outside this course, the PD program is designed to promote growth in your teaching practice, providing space for teachers to become comfortable with the curricular materials and associated teaching strategies.\n\n#### Program features that open the door for growth:\n\n+ **Teaching and Learning in Context:** Our PD model enables participants to engage with the curriculum both as teachers and as learners. Through experiencing curriculum content as an active learner, participants gain important insight into the experiences their students will have during the academic year. Additionally, by interacting with curriculum content as instructors, participants gain essential experience planning and delivering lessons.\n\n+ __A collaborative, participant-centric approach:__ Workshops and activities encourage participants and facilitators to share their expertise from the field and collaborate on strategies to bring to ECS. Our PD program provides an opportunity to learn from everyone in the room. Facilitators model behavior and pedagogical approaches, and participants share their own approaches by planning and delivering lessons. \n\n\n#### Phase 1: Online introduction\n**Overview:** The first phase of professional development is a two-hour online introduction that focuses on providing a foundational knowledge of the ECS course resources. It creates a space for participants to become familiar with the curriculum and the online PD platform.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n* I have created my teacher account.\n* I know what ECS is, specifically Code.org's ECS course.\n* I am familiar with the Code.org PD tools.\n* I am excited to go to Phase 2!\n\n#### Phase 2: Blended summer study\n**Overview:** The second phase of professional development is a blended in-person and follow-up online experience.\n\n* **In-person workshop:** This 5-day workshop is the primary capacity building experience for teachers prior to their first year of instruction. Participants will explore curriculum, tools, classroom management, and teaching strategies. Spending practical time working with the curriculum, you will develop an understanding of how to effectively use the materials and pedagogical strategies that are part of any strong computer science classroom.\n\n* **Online follow-up:** This 8-hour online experience provides space to plan the beginning of the\nacademic year. Teachers will dive deeper into the curriculum reflecting on lessons students\nwill be taught in the class. Additionally, this online piece introduces an opportunity to build a\ncollaborative professional online learning community --- an important teacher tool during the\nfirst-year of teaching this course.\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\n* I know where to find resources and supports I need to teach this class.\n* I am part of a professional learning community of teachers.\n* I am learning how to teach CS in a way that broadens participation.\n* I am confident I can teach this course. My students and I can learn this content together... and it will be ok.\n* I understand the educational philosophy behind the ECS curriculum.\n* I have thought about and discussed the things to look out for in the CS classroom (equity issues, etc).\n* I have thought about and discussed how the ECS materials will work in the classroom and am ready for the first week.\n\n#### Phase 3: Academic year development\n**Overview:** The third phase of professional development is composed of blended ongoing\nquarterly in-person meetings and monthly online activities.\n\n* **In-person quarterly workshops:** These quarterly meetings will continue to build pedagogical\nstrategies and explore the essential elements of this course. You will participate in activities\nsuch as teaching new content and keeping the classroom environment equitable and\nengaging for all students.\n* **Online monthly activities:** These online activities are focused on building the online\nprofessional learning community\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\n* My professional learning community is a good place for me to turn for support, both in and\nout of PD.\n* I have a better idea of the curriculum because I've had a chance to explore it more deeply\nwith my professional learning community.\n* I have even more ideas about leading an engaging and equitable ECS classroom.\n\n#### Phase 4: Summer wrap-up\n**Overview:** The fourth phase of professional development is an in-person workshop focused\non diving deeper into content and material that was difficult to teach the first time. The fourth\nphase addresses curricular materials with an eye for teaching and learning in context. Teachers\nwill reflect on what success looks like in an ECS course and how to recruit diverse groups of\nstudents. The workshop will empower teachers to take ownership of the curriculum by making\nadjustments and changes in order to meet the needs of each classroom.\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\n* I look forward to teaching the course again based on my reflection of the past year.\n* I am more comfortable with the material that I struggled with the first time teaching this\ncourse.\n* I understand how to make changes to the ECS curriculum in order to meet my local needs\nand fit into my context.\n\n\n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n\n\n"
