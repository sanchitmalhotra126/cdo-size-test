Use what you know about CSS properties, values and classes to style your recipe instructions to look like notecards. You will be able to pick custom colors using the RGB color function.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\nThe goal is to use CSS classes to make notecards for the recipe’s ingredients and directions. To do this, we will separate that content into two “notecard” divs and add classes to the elements to style the two elements on the notecard, the header and the lists.\r\n\r\nPut the elements of the Ingredients and Directions into their own div element.\r\nAssign each div element the class “notecard”\r\nAdd a style rule for the notecard class\r\n\r\nChange the border color to match the background color of your recipe page. \r\n.notecard {\r\n  border: outset 5px YOURBACKGROUNDCOLOR;\r\n  height: 350px;\r\n  width: 700px;\r\n  color:gray\r\n  \r\n}\r\nNow think about how to make a custom color for the notecard - it should be mostly white with maybe a hint of yellow. Use Level 6 as a reference and/or try the Color Picker.\r\nAdd a rule to the notecard class to turn the notecard into your custom color\r\n\r\n  background-color: rgb(RED_VALUE, GREEN_VALUE, BLUE_VALUE);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow style each item in the list to have a thin black bottom border\r\n\r\n              Hint\r\n\r\n.notecard li {\r\n  YOUR BORDER RULE HERE\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, style the h3 headers to be in a different font and have a thin pink bottom border\r\n",
