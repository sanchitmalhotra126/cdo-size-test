Where is the overlap? How might you integrate this into your course?\n\n| Unit of Study | Description | Standards |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| <h4>Video Games and Coordinate Planes</h4> | Students reverse-engineer a simple video game into a series of coordinates, and explore Cartesian space. Once they are comfortable with coordinates, they brainstorm their own games and begin programming simple arithmetic expressions with Evaluation Blocks. | <ul><li>A-SSE.1.2</li><li>N-Q</li><li>6.NS.6</li><li>6.NS.8</li></ul> |\n| <h4>Contracts, Strings and Images</h4> | Students are introduced to a set-mapping representation for functions, in which the function translates points from a Domain to a Range. Students generalize their understanding of functions to include Strings and Images. | <ul><li>F-IF.1-3</li></ul> |\n| <h4>Defining Functions</h4> | Students define values of various types, as well as linear functions. | <ul><li>A-SSE.1-2</li><li>F-IF.1-3</li><li>7.EE.4.a</li><li>F-BF.1-2</li></ul> |\n| <h4>The Design Recipe</h4> | Students are introduced to the process for deriving functions from Word Problems using worked-through examples, called the Design Recipe. | <ul><li>8.F.1</li><li>F-IF.1-3</li><li>F-IF.4-6</li></ul> |\n| <h4>Game Animation</h4> | Students solve Word Problems that describe animation, and define functions that map character positions in their game from one frame to the next. | <ul><li>F-LE.5</li><li>F-IF.7-9</li></ul> |\n| <h4>Boundary Detection</h4> | Students discover Boolean types and inequalities in the plane, and use them to create programs that test locations of a character on the screen. They then solve Word Problems that deal with Boundary-Detection, writing code to detect when a character has gone off-screen. | <ul><li>6.EE.b.5</li><li>7.EE.3</li><li>8.IF.1</li><li>A-CED.1-4</li></ul> |\n| <h4>Piecewise Functions</h4> | Students use geometry and conditional branching to move their player characters in response to key-presses. The Word Problem for key-events describes a function that behaves differently under different sub-domains, requiring students to learn about Piecewise Functions. | <ul><li>A-SSE.1-2</li></ul> |\n| <h4>Collision Detection</h4> | Students derive, discuss, and prove the Pythagorean theorem, then use this theorem---in conjunction with Booleans---to detect collisions in their games. | <ul><li>8.G.6</li><li>F-IF.1-3</li><li>F-IF.4-6</li></ul> |\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue</a>\n",
