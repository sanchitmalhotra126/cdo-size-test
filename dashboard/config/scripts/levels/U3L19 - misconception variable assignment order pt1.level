Well here is the next one.\n\nTake a look at this code and try to predict what will be written to the screen.\n\n<pre>\nvar a = 3;\nvar b = 7;\na = b;\nb = a;\n\nwrite(\"The value of a is: \" + a);\nwrite(\"The value of b is: \" + b);\n</pre>\n\nCan you predict what the values of a and b are after these lines of code have executed? Go ahead and make a prediction. Write it down. Then click next to test it out.\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary next-stage submitButton\">Continue to see if your prediction is right.</a>\n\n\n"
