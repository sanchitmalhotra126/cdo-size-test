In order to differentiate between these different parts we use HTML elements to mark the different parts. \r\n\r\nHeaders are the different sized section titles throughout a web page. Headers help to break up a web page so itâ€™s easier for a user to read.\r\n\r\nYou can make something a header element by surrounding it by header tags.  For example:\r\n<pre> &lt;h1&gt; Header Text &lt;/h1&gt; </pre>\r\n\r\nNotice how there is a the opening tag (&lt;h1&gt;) and closing tag (&lt;/h1&gt;). The closing tag is the same as the opening tag except it has `/` after the opening angle bracket. The text you want to show as the header goes in the middle of the two tags.\r\n\r\n# Do This\r\n\r\n* Make your header \"Animals\" stand out using the `<h1>` element.",
