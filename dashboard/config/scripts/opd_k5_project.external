# Overview: End of course projects

## New teaching practice: End of ccourse projects

Each course offers the opportunity for students to take what theyâ€™ve learned and put it together into a unique project that represents their own creativity. Students are encouraged to plan, build, revise, and present projects of their own. Following a project from inception to delivery offers an inside look at the software development cycle. These guided projects offer scaffolded rubrics for the benefit of both student and teacher.
