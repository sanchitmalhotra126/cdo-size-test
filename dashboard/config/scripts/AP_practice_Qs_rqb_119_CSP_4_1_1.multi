A student is writing a program to solve a problem. She decides to draw a flowchart to visually represent the algorithm. The flowchart uses the oval block to represent the start or end of the algorithm,  a diamond to represent the conditional or decision step which determines the execution path of the algorithm, a rectangle to represent one or more processing steps, and a parallelogram to represent an input statement.
