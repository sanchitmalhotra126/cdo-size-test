#Lesson Investigation: Unit 4 Lesson 2

**Estimated Time: 30 minutes**

## Overview

Now, let's go on to investigate Unit 4, Lesson 2: Understanding Your User which encourages students to think about how to design for different users.  Students engage in choosing a product for a specific user, critiquing product design, and suggesting improvements. 

Lesson 2 builds on Lesson 1 by having students consider potential users, in addition to the users a product was originally designed for. Empathy is still a component of the design process and now includes potential users. Students continue to apply the Problem Solving Process.

## Goals

* Review user profiles that students will use

* Identify ways to assess students on
	* making connections between a user profile and user preferences for a product
    * making connections between a user profile and adding features to a product
