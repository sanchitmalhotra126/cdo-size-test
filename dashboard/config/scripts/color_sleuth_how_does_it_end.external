# The End Game

Need to decide rule to end the game.

End game discussion

* First to 10
* Stop when one player's score differs by 3 or more?
* First to get 3 wrong

Pick one and do it.

Note that like with swtiching turns

You not only need to know that game is over, but who won.

We've added a screen you can switch to, and congratulate the winner.
