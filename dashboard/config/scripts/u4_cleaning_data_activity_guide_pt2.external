# Cleaning Data

Even when it is collected carefully (and especially if it isn't) **data usually has issues that make it difficult to use for analysis**. Values may have been entered incorrectly, not be in a usable format, or your data might just be poorly organized. It is important to fix these issues prior to exploring the data for trends and patterns. 

**The process of preparing data for analyis is called "cleaning" the data**.

# Fixing Errors

As you looked through your data you probably already noticed errors. Sometimes it's easy to know how to fix an error in the data. At other times it's not as obvious.

In general, **if you are certain what the data is supposed to be, you can change it by hand. Otherwise it is better to just delete it.**

**Do This:** Use sorting and searching to find errors in your data. Are some values too large or too small to make sense? Did some users input text when they should have used a number? Correct the errors that you can and delete the values that make no sense.

*"umm" and "-2" can't be easily fixed so they are deleted. "15 minutes" and "2 hours" are corrected since it's clear what the data is supposed to mean*

# Categorizing Data

In order to use computers to analyze data we usually need it to be **standardized in some way**. Data collected as "free text" will typically be too messy to use for making a table or chart. In order to fix this you can **create new columns of data which standardize data that is otherwise disorganized**.

**Do This:** Create new columns that standardize any columns of data collected as "free text", as shown below.

**Note: Categorizing data in this way will require you to make judgment calls. There rarely will be one "right" way to do it**.

*Standardizing how people relaxed by how they do the activity. This is only one of many different ways this data could be categorized*
