## Day 25-30 Scratch â€“ Final Project

First, let's explore the first lesson in the curriculum. To begin, find your ECS Version 5 curriculum and open to page 183-190.

#### Key Concepts
- Students are going to create a final game that will use all of the blocks they've learned so far in Unit 4.

#### Common Difficulties

You will want to walk through your expectations for the project.  You can use the rubric provided or create your own.

When students have the opportunity to create their own program, I'd recommend having them start small.  Have them make a storyboard of their idea and an algorithm for what they want their program to do.  They may want to have another person in the class be their peer helper and check off their project at different stages and ask questions and be a second set of eyes on how to create the program they are thinking of.

### PD Discussion Forum

Now that you have have seen the curriculum taught from Unit 1- Unit 4, why do you think it is important for you to make connections while teaching back to Unit 1,2 and 3 or forward to an upcoming unit? What connections have you seen so far in the curriculum?  How does it benefit the student to intentionally make those connections?
