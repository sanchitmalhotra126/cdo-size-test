## Unit 2: Lesson 12 - Global Impacts of the Internet

# Background

The Internet and the technologies built on it have had a significant impact on society. Computer networks support communication and collaboration. You've learned about the physical nature of networks, Internet Protocols, routing, packets, scaling, redundancy, reliability, DNS, and HTTP. All of these technologies are connected to the social impacts of the Internet, such as Accessibility, Net Neutrality, Commercial/Government Filtering, Innovation, Privacy, and Digital Access. This lesson is essential practice for the Explore Performance Task later on in the school year.
