## CS Concepts

A **sprite** is a graphic character on the screen with properties that describe its location, movement, and look.

A **behavior** is an action that a sprite performs continuously until it's told to stop.

Read the **context-setting** lesson plan, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16r9HpwQodVnmSfRlfJmOfZajqE66YlZz0aG60CFsVMk/template/preview" target="blank">Course E - Lesson 1:  Follow the Algorithm</a> from Course E that first introduces students to sprites.

Also, preview the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16r9HpwQodVnmSfRlfJmOfZajqE66YlZz0aG60CFsVMk/template/preview" target="blank">teacher slides</a> that accompany Course E - Lesson 1:  Follow the Algorithm.

**Note:**  The lesson plan and teacher slides each open in a new window.  Be sure to return to this online course to continue with lessons.

## Learning Tools 

Sprites are created in Sprite Lab where they practice coding with algorithms, loops, and conditionals.

## Concepts reiterated across Courses E and F

**Course E** introduces what a sprite is and how to code the behavior of sprites. 

**Course F** also introduces students to sprites to support those students who may not have engaged with Course E. Course F focuses on how apps and tools give users choices about how to use sprites.
