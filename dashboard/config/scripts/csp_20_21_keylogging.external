##Vocabulary

**Keylogging** is the use of a program to record every keystroke made by a computer user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information.

## Sample

[Keylogging App](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/A0gYPPIRfBsS_5fHz6VzZTZoefZe2zwzJcijd4vuGAs)

**Note:** This is an approximation of what a keylogging app does. However, it is not a true keylogger, as it only works when you are directly running the app. If you navigate to another browser tab, notice that it stops logging your keystrokes.
