# ECS Curriculum Connections
<br>
While you work through the curriculum, you will see that it spirals, always making connections forwards and backwards to build on studentsâ€™ depth and level of understanding. It is critical that you teach the units in order, as Unit 1 and Unit 2 are foundational in that they will introduce all of the themes of the curriculum in a such a way that students will be able to experience them and build upon their understanding then be able to apply that knowledge to Unit 3 and Unit 4 in new situations, and then again extend the application thereof to Unit 5 and Unit 6.

Keep in mind that each one of your students comes to your course with a different background and understanding of how computers work and may even have little or limited exposure to using the computer to solve problems, rather than it use it to be a device for social media, games or entertainment.
