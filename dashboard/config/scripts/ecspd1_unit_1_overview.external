Fundamental notions of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and ergonomics are introduced.</li><br>
 
<li>In addition, students will learn that “intelligent” machine behavior is not “magic” but is based on algorithms applied to useful representations of information, including large data sets.</li> <br>
