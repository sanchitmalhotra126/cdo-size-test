# Functions > Unplugged lessons

Programmers are always looking for ways to make their code more efficient. One way that they do that is through **functions**, which allow them to reuse segments of code

**1. Review "[Functions: Songwriting](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/coursee/14/)" Lesson Plan from Course E.**
<br/>
Course E is meant for students in Grade 4. Functions are not covered in Courses A-D. 

**2. Watch the student video: Functions: Songwriting**
<br/>
This is a video that you would show your students to help introduce the concept of functions and kick off the unplugged lesson.

**3. Watch a teacher model this lesson: "Functions: Songwriting"**
<br/>
This video is meant to be support for you as the teacher, if you are looking for tips on how to run this lesson.
