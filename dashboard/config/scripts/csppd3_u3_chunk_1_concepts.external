### Unit 3 Overview > Introduction to Events and Apps: Concepts

<br><br>
We spend lessons 9 - 13 shifting gears to event-driven programming, which means students will 

<br><br>

#### Variables

<br>
These lessons help students understand how to control the computer programmatically while using very basic commands. 

<br><br>
>**CS Concepts:** How do I control the computer programmatically?

>- using basic, built-in functions
- building functions helps prevent the need to repeate code.

#### Using and Making Functions with Parameters
Now that students have a sense of why it's useful to create their own functions, they move one step further and build functions that are more generally useful and accept parameters. For example: App Lab has a built-in function called moveForward("parameter"), which lets us move the turtle any distance-- moveForward(5) and moveForward(500) both use the same function, but move the turtle 5 steps and 500 steps, respectively. 
<br><br>
By having functions that are more general, we reduce the duplication of code across our programs.  
<br>
>**CS Concepts:** How do I make functions even more useful?

>- generalized functions that accept parameters

#### Simple Looping and Random Numbers
Students use loops and the built-in random number function to draw a random number of things that are randomly different sizes. These tools are applied to build a digital drawing that looks slightly different every time the program is run, because placement of items is randomly assigned based on the number that is generated. 
<br><br>
>**CS Concepts:** How do I avoid repeating code with loops?

>- loops are used in a program to simplify the expression of repeated tasks
- random can be used to create a program that behaves differently each time it is executed


#### Practice PT
Students work together to apply what theyâ€™ve learned about functions and simple loops to create a "digital scene" that is made up of functions that were written by different members of the group and were brought together to create the final product.
