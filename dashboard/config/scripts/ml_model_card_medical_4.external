<br />

**Describe the dataset used to create this model:** Data from a month of ER visits at a the Junea, Alaska hospital. It shows information about each patient, the symptoms they had, and how quickly they received help.

**Has the model been trained on data that can be used to identify a subgroup of the population (ie: by age, gender, race, etc)**
  - [] Yes
  - [x] No

**This model could be used to inform decisions central to human life:**
  - [x] Yes
  - [ ] No

**The data has been cleaned & prepared before being used to train the model:**
  - [x] Yes
  - [ ] No

## Data Concerns

The features of this dataset are very specific to the area it serves. Many of the questions are probably not relevant in other climates, or skew based on the area they are in (for example, in a desert climate, the temperature is almost always above 50 degrees). The Model Disclaimers section mentions that this data was collected in Alaska, which means it may be too specific to that area to be used elsewhere.
