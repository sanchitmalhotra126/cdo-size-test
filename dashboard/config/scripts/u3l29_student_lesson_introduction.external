## Unit 3: Lesson 23 - Loops and Simulations

# Background

We often can develop intuitions for patterns by performing real-life experiments at small scale, but verifying our intuitions with larger experiments can prove prohibitively time-consuming, costly, or even dangerous. If we can develop a model or simulation of the phenomenon we wish to investigate we can confirm our hypotheses much more quickly without the risks or costs associated with a real-life experiment.

# Lesson

* Calculate statistics from a coin flipping experiment
* Create a simulation to repeat this experiment for much larger inputs
* Create an update hypotheses based on the results of simulations.
