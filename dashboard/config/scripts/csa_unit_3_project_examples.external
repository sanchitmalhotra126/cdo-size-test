#CSA Unit 3 Project Examples

[Student Example 1](https://studio.code.org/projects/javalab/uHY6HoZ2igaYvabsT97E5GWnAHwojJypT0WTq5lZSpI)

[Student Example 2](https://studio.code.org/projects/javalab/SuSKc8dUMGBI0703QvyztI7mlTZW_jOBZlV4_CD-fOQ)

[Student Example 3](https://studio.code.org/s/csa3-pilot/lessons/13/levels/1?section_id=3591632&user_id=82164073): Interesting animation of art he created in another class and alignment of sounds to what's happening. Did not show a new use of a static variable or constant or correctly identify a previous use (like in increaseVolume). A top student in my class.

[Student Example 4](https://studio.code.org/s/csa3-pilot/lessons/13/levels/1?section_id=3591632&user_id=81642192): Code doesn't compile; student spent a lot of time coming up with the best idea and then ran out of time to execute it. This student struggles more than any other student in my class.

[Student Example 5](https://studio.code.org/s/csa3-pilot/lessons/13/levels/1?section_id=3591632&user_id=64804024): Code uses images, text, and shapes without animation. Student is usually in the middle of the class academically but did well on this project.
