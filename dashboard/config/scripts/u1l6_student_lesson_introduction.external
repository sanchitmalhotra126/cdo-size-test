## Unit 1: Lesson 6 - Number Systems

# Background
Numbers are just markings on paper with rules about how to get from one number to the next. The “binary number system” that is so fundamental to computing is a logical way of representing numbers with values that have two possible states. Representing values using a finite set of patterns in predictable sequences is the basis of a number system.


# Lesson
* Count using circles, triangles, and squares.
* Create a number systems with non-numeric symbols. 
* Write the rules for counting with your number system.
