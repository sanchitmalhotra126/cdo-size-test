# One Chart, Two Chart, Red Chart, Blue Chart

Different types of charts allow people to make sense of data in different ways. In this lesson, you will learn to make **scatter**, **line**, and **bar charts**, but there are many other types of visualizations that people use to interpret data in different ways. You will see that **you can use the same table of data to make several different types of charts**! Look through the Data Visualizations 101 resource and familiarize yourself with the different chart types, **paying particular attention to the scatter, line, and bar charts.**

# Disclaimer

This lesson is about using charts to **explore** trends in the data - **not** about creating the worldâ€™s greatest chart! While the early parts of the lesson will walk you through very specific steps to make a particular chart, by the end of the lesson you will be creating your own customized charts to **see what trends you can discover in the data**.
