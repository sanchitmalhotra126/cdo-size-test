## Unit 2: Lesson 6 - Algorithms Detour - Minimum Spanning Tree

# Background

The Minimum Spanning Tree is a type of problem known as Graph Theory. Graph are often used to solve problems in networks, schedules, and logistics and are common in computer science. The MST problem is especially interesting because it might have multiple “best” solutions.

# Vocabulary

* <b>Graph</b>: a diagram that shows the nodes and edges of a problem
* <b>Node</b>: sometimes called a vertex; typically represented as a labeled circle
* <b>Edge</b>: a line connecting two nodes
* <b>Cost</b>: sometimes called the weight; the number associated with an edge that indicates distance, time, or economic cost 
* <b>Cycle</b>: a set of edges that, begin at one node and can be followed through other nodes back where you started
* <b>Tree</b>: a set of edges that connects nodes together in a way that does not form a cycle


# Lesson

* Investigate graph problems
* Create an algorithm for solving a minimum spanning tree problem
* Compare your algorithm to Kruskal’s algorithm
