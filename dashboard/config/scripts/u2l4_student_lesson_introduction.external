## Unit 2: Lesson 4 - Routers and Addresses as Numbers

# Background

Just like the post office uses standardized zip codes and addresses, the Internet uses a standardized numeric addressing system called Internet Protocol (IP) to route messages to specific locations.  Numeric IP addresses have a structure and hierarchy in much the same way that telephone numbers have a structure and hierarchy (with country and area codes first).

# Vocabulary

 IP address: a unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.

# Lesson

* Learn about Internet routing datagrams.
* Send messages to classmates using numeric addressing protocol with the Internet Simulator.
* Find the IP address of your local router and computer.
