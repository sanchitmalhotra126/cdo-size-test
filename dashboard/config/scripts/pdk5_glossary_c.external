## Vocabulary

Encouraging students to learn and use professional terms enables them to communicate correctly and efficiently with others and build their knowledge such that it can be further developed without having to relearn terms and concepts at a later time. The terms and concepts used in these courses are defined using words that most young students can understand.

# TEACHING TIP
Best practice is to introduce the terms with easy-to-understand language, relate the terms to previous experiences, use the terms repeatedly beyond the lesson itself throughout the entire course (and in other situations) when appropriate, and reinforce studentsâ€™ use in oral and written communication.

#Glossary
Here is a [list of vocabulary terms](http://code.org/curriculum/docs/k-5/glossary) used throughout Courses 1, 2, and 3. The list of vocabulary terms is in the teacher dashboard in the "Lesson Plans and Resources" tile. You don't have to learn all these words right now. Use that list as a reference during this online PD course and when you use our courses with your students.
