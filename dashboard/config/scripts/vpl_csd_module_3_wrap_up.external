#Module 3 Asynchronous Wrap Up

## Engage with the Code.org Community

Check out the <a href="https://forum.code.org/" target="blank">Code.org forum</a>  for ideas on implementing Unit 4. The forum is a great place to go when you are looking for additional resources, ideas, and templates to use with Code.org lessons - created and shared by teachers within the community. Share your ideas and resources too!

## Next Steps

1. Return to your cohort's shared slide deck for Module 3 found on the Digital Digest.
2. Add any questions you have to the "Questions from Asynchronous Work" slide. If you have answers or ideas to any of the questions already there, add them to the "Answer" column. 
3. Answer the reflection question on the "Group Reflection" slide. Facilitators will read these to plan for the next workshop together. Other participants will see what you write in this section.
4. Take the pre-survey for the Module 3 Workshop.
5. Join the Module 3 Synchronous Workshop. The date and time of the next call is on the Digital Digest.
