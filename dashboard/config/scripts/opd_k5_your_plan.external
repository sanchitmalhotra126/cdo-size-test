# PLANNING > Your Plan

As you think about how how you might in the future teach computer science using any of the code.org or Code Studio resources, take a moment to [share your plan with the Professional Learning Community (PLC)](http://forum.code.org/t/teaching-computer-science-your-plans/412).

Share with us:

- What are your goals for your classroom? How will CS or code.org resources help you meet those goals?

- What are you most excited about when it comes to implementing some of these resources?

- What challenges do you forsee in trying to meet your goals?

- What questions do you have that this community might help you answer?

After posting your initial plan, feel free to revisit [this thread](http://forum.code.org/t/teaching-computer-science-your-plans/412)in the future to update us on how things are going!
