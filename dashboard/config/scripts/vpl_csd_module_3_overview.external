# Module 3: CS Discoveries Virtual Professional Learning

## Module 3 Overview

Welcome to the asynchronous work for Module 3 for CS Discoveries!  

Module 3 introduces Unit 4 - The Design Process. The asynchronous work here will feed into the upcoming synchronous workshop of this module and help you understand the content and curriculum as you prepare to teach your own students. Combined, these asynchronous tasks should take about 90 minutes to complete, but you can start and stop at your own pace.

Module 3 builds on Modules 1 and 2 which focused on "The Role of the Teacher". Module 3 focuses on "The Role of the Student" and active learning in the classroom. As you progress through this asynchronous work, consider your role as the teacher in  facilitating active learning for your students. 

**During this asynchronous work you will:**

* Preview Unit 4 content which focuses on user centered software design
* Become familiar with the Problem Solving Process for Design to solve complex problems
* Support students in developing empathy for users
* Reflect on the role of the student and active learning
