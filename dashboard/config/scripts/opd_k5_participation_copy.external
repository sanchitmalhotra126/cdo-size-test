# Planning your participation

Before you begin, take a moment to consider your learning needs, goals and the unique experience of learning in an online, self-paced environment -- especially if this is your first online course!

## Take the pre-survey
We want you to get as much as possible out of this professional development. For that reason, we ask you to fill out [this short pre-survey](https://form.jotform.com/90556900301146). The survey will ask you to reflect on your goals for this course and will tell us a little bit about who you are and how we can support you.

## Go at your own pace

This self-paced online course is designed to put you in the driver's seat, and give you control over your own learning. **Please take your time and work through this course at your own pace. Suggested times are given for each stage.** If you find yourself spending more or less time on a given stage, don't worry! Our main goal is for you to have fun, learn the basics, and apply what you learn in your classroom practice in whatever way works best for you.

## Find help when you need it

If you get stuck at any time during the course, head over to [support.code.org](http://support.code.org) and check out [our community forums](https://support.code.org/hc/communities/public/topics). You'll likely find the answer to your question there. If you don't or are still stuck, you can email [support@code.org](mailto:support@code.org) and a Code.org staff member will get back to you as soon as they can.

Another way to get support, which we highly recommend, is to work through this online course with a partner or group of colleagues!

## Find the learning experience that works for you

Finally, online learning is not for everyone. This course has no instructor or built-in mechanism for communicating in real-time with your peers. If you find yourself needing more one-on-one attention or know you learn better in a real-world classroom where there is more opportunity for collaboration and engagement, we recommend you pursue one of our [in-person professional development opportunities](http://code.org/professional-development-workshops).

## What's your plan?

> Take a moment now to consider how and when you will complete this online course to ensure you get the most benefit from the experience. When you've got a good plan sketched out, continue on to dive more deeply into Stage 1.
