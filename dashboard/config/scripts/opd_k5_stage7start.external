# EVENTS > Stage Overview

Thus far, you’ve learned how to sequence a program, add loops, and use conditionals and functions. You’re almost done! In this stage, we’re going to look at “events”, a core concept in computer science. As we explore events, you will synthesize what you’ve learned so far and write some more complex programs.

By completing Stage 7, you will:

- Define "events" and explain their importance
- Practice coding simple events
- Reflect on classroom application

## What to Expect in this Stage:

We’ll start with a video explaining events. Then, we’ll explore some puzzles that allow you to experiment with events. We’ll close with an opportunity to reflect. You should spend between 20-45 minutes on this stage.

Ready? Let's go!
