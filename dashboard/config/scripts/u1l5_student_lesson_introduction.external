## Unit 1: Lesson 5 - Sending Bits in the Real World

# Background
The Internet is an interconnected system of various types of bit-sending devices. In the “real world,” a copper wire is used to transmit binary messages using electricity - a voltage on the wire means one thing, and no voltage means the other. Fiber-optic cables use light (literally on or off) to transmit a binary message. Bits are sent using a variety of mediums, each of which has benefits and drawbacks. 

# What happens in this lesson?
* Investigate how bits are transmitted on the Internet.
* Present your finding to your classmates.
