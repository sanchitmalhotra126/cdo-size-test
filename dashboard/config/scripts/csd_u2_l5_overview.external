# Overview

This lesson takes a step back from creating the personal website to talk about personal information people choose to share digitally.  The class begins by discussing what types of information are good to share with other people, then looks at several sample social media pages to see what types of personal information could be shared intentionally or unintentionally.  Finally, the class comes up with a set of guidelines to follow when putting information online.
