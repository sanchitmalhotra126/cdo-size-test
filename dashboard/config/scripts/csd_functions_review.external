# Functions Review

# Calling Functions

Functions let you build your own blocks and decide what code goes inside of them. This is the command that lets you create a new function.

You use or "call" your function like any other block by using the name you gave it.

The blocks to create and call functions can be found in the "Functions" tab of the palette.

Placing code inside functions makes it easy to read and make changes to. Good names for functions indicate what your program is doing to a reader. You can call your functions in a different order to quickly make significant changes to how your program runs.

You'll often want to use the same code at many places in your program. Once you've created a function you can call it as many times as you like.

A nice benefit of using functions to remove repeated code is that you can now easily make changes to multiple places in your code. Just change how you create the functions, and your program will now use the new code everywhere your function is called.

In Game Lab all the action is happening in the draw loop, but too much complex code makes it really confusing to read. To keep your draw loop easy to read, begin by writing functions for larger chunks of code. You can then go write them below. This is a really good example of using abstraction to think about problems at a high level and worry about details later.

# Reviewing Functions

### **Creating (Naming) a Function**

A function is a group of commands (blocks) that you give a name. This code is making a new function called 
"resetDrawing" that contains 4 commands.

### **Calling (Using) a Function**

Whenever you want to use your function you need to call it by its name. To do this you just write the name of your function followed by parentheses. This will run all the commands you put inside your function when you made it.

### **Why Use Functions?**

1. **Keeping Your Code Organized** Functions can be created anywhere in your program. If you have large blocks of code you won't be using often, you can create a function at the bottom of your code and just call it in a single line higher up.

2. **Keeping Your Code Readable** By giving a group of commands a name you're helping explain how your code works. Picking good names helps you and other people reading your code understand what it is doing.

3. **Removing Repetition** Once you've created a function you can call it as many times as you like in your program. If you're using the same code in many places in your program you can create a function with that code that you can call instead. This makes it easy to change code in multiple places too.
