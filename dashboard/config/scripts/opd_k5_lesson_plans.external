## Where do I find lesson plans?
You can see all the lesson plans for all of the CS Fundamentals courses [here](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/). 

## Are there lesson plans for unplugged ***and*** plugged lessons?
Yes! 

## How are lesson plans structured?

Every lesson plan has a common structure designed to make it easy to find what you need. As you plan for a lesson, we recommend starting with the overview, then reviewing the core activity to get a deeper sense of what will happen in the lesson and how long it might take.
