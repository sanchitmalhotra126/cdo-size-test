# Making A Bar Chart

In this exercise, you will use some different columns in the spreadsheet to create a bar chart. Bar charts are useful for viewing data grouped by different categories.

# Select Data

**Do This:** Select the cells you want to use to create your chart. For this chart, you’ll want to use the values for “age,” “number of women,” and “number of men.”

* **Hint:** To select cells in non-adjacent columns, you need to use some fancy hotkeys:
	1. First select the cells from the first column (i.e. A1 through A62) using the SHIFT+click combination. 
	2. Then, hold down COMMAND (if using a Mac) or CONTROL (if using Windows) and click to select the first cell of the next column (i.e. E1).
	3. Finally, hold COMMAND/CONTROL **and** SHIFT simultaneously, then click to select the last cell in the new column (i.e. E62).
	4. Repeat steps 2-3 for any additional columns you want to select (i.e. G1 through G62).

# Insert Chart

**Do This:** Select **Insert -> Chart** from the main toolbar to open the Chart Editor.

* In the Chart Editor, ignore the Google suggestions and play around with the different chart types and pay attention to how the chart preview changes.
* After you’ve explored some different chart types, change the chart type to “Column chart.”
	* Make sure you’ve checked the boxes for “Use row 1 as headers” and “Use column A as labels.”
* Click "Insert" to add your chart to the spreadsheet.

# Do a Visual Check

At this point, your chart should look something like this:

Once your chart looks close to the one above, switch to View mode and take a moment to look at your visualization.

* What does this chart help you notice about the data?
* For which ages were the number of ratings similar between men and women?
* For which ages were they different?
* What other connections and trends can you see from this chart?

After you’ve thought about these questions, move on to the next section to learn how to further customize your chart.
