# Challenge 2


This app addresses the problem of someoneâ€™s cell phone ringing in class.  It should be able to figure out when the phone is at a school, and turn the ringer off during that time, but turn it back on when the user leaves school.

Look at the possible information that you can input to your app, and decide which ones your app needs to work.  Remember, you can use the phone to get information that is specific to the user, and use the Internet to get general information about the world.

Once you have the information that you need as input, decide what your app will output.
