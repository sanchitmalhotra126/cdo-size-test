# A Worked Example

The following shows a step-by-step, line-by-line execution of a 10-line program with if-statements that uses the AP pseudocode for if-statements and the robot.

The purpose of the example is to show:

* Code executes one line at a time from top to bottom.
* Each if-statement condition is checked in the order of execution
* The conditions of later if-statements may be affected by what did, or didnâ€™t happen, in earlier lines of code.
