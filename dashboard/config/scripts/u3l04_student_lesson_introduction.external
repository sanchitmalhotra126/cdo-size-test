## Unit 3: Lesson 04 - Creating Procedures Part 2

# Background

Large problems can be “abstracted” into sub-problems. Sometimes even the sub-problems can be abstracted into even more basic sub-sub-problems. This is referred to as “levels of abstraction.” There is not necessarily only one way to abstract a problem. Different approaches can be equally valid.

# Lesson

* Play a “What’s That Made Up Of?” game.
* View a video explaining of procedural abstraction. 
* Compare different approaches to abstracting a problem into sub-problems.
