# Making A Line Chart

Now, you’ll learn how to take the scatter chart you made in the previous lesson and turn it into a line chart. Line charts are helpful for showing the progression of values over time. In this case, you will be showing how the average movie rating changes with the reviewer’s age.

# Change Chart Type

Open the Chart Editor and change the chart type from a scatter chart to a line chart. Don’t forget to make sure both the “Use row 1 as headers” and “Use column A as labels” boxes are checked!

# Add Multiple Lines

Now it’s time to spice up your chart by adding some additional lines! Let’s add two lines that show the breakdown of average movie rating by gender.

In the Chart Editor, click the “Select data range” icon ([INSERT ICON “Select Rows Icon.PNG”]) to edit the cell selection for your chart.

Each column you select will get its own separate “range.” For this chart, you will notice that the “age” and “avg rating” columns are already included in the first range.

**Do This:** Add two more ranges to your chart: one for “avg rating women” and one for “avg rating men.” Don’t forget to include the column header in your selection! Click “OK” to see the preview of your new chart.

* **Note:** If your chart preview hasn’t refreshed with the new ranges yet, try switching the chart type to another type and then back to a line chart. This will force the chart preview to refresh.

# Remove a Line

You may have noticed that, with three lines on one graph, your chart becomes a little cluttered and more difficult to read. Let’s make it easier to compare average rating by gender by removing the line for “avg rating.” 

**Do This:** Open the “Select data range” menu again, and reassign the first range to be ONLY the values from the “age” column (effectively removing the values from the “avg rating” column). Click “OK” to see the new preview of your chart. Notice that it’s now much easier to see the compare the average ratings for men vs. women.

# Add a Legend

Now that you have multiple lines in the same chart, you need to add the chart legend back in, so people can tell which line is which.

You may notice that the labels in your legend are not very official-looking. To change the text that appears on the chart, you have to change the text in the column headers themselves.

**Do This:** Open the Chart editor. Add a legend to your chart, and change the legend labels to “Avg. Rating: Women” and “Avg. Rating: Men.”

* Note: If you can’t read your legend labels because the text is overlapping, try adjusting the style (bold, italics, etc.) of your legend.

# Adjust Chart Boundaries

Examine both the far right and far left sides of your chart. Notice that both the men’s and women’s lines do not run continuously across the entire graph. The men’s line has a gap on the left side of the chart, and the women’s line ends shortly after age 55 and only has a few dots after that. These discontinuities appear because there are gaps in the data set.

**Do This:** Open the “Customization” tab in the Chart Editor. Adjust the boundaries for your chart’s x-axis using the “Min” and “Max” text inputs. Set “Min” equal to the smallest age value you want displayed on the x-axis, and set “Max” equal to the largest. Try to minimize the discontinuities shown in your chart while still displaying as much of the two lines as possible.

* **Note:** Similarly, if you want to adjust the boundaries for the y-axis, select “Left vertical” from the “Axis” dropdown menu and adjust “Min” and “Max” for that axis.

# Final Result:

Once your chart looks close to the one above, switch to View mode and take a moment to look at your visualization.

What does this chart help you notice about the data? For which ages were the average ratings similar between men and women? For which ages were they different? What other connections and trends can you see from this chart?

After you’ve thought about these questions, move on to the next section to learn how to make a line chart.
