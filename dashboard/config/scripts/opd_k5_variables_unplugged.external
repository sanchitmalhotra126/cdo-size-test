# Unplugged Lesson: Envelope Variables

<br/>

**1. Review "[Envelope Variables](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/coursef/6/)" Lesson Plan from Course F.**
<br/>
Course F is meant for students in Grade 5. This is the only place where variables come up in Courses A-F.
<br/><br/>

**2. Watch the student video: Envelope Variables**
<br/>
This is a video that you would show your students to help introduce the concept of variables and kick off the unplugged lesson.
