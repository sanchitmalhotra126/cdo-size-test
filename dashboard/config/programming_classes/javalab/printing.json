The general syntax for printing is ``System.out.println()`` or  ``System.out.print()``.\n\n``System``: is a final class defined in Java.lang\n\n``out``: is an instance of PrintStream, which is part of the System class.\n\n``println`` & ``print``: are methods\n\n###the difference between println() and print()\n\n\n\n\n\n***println()***: adds a line separator (new line) after the printed statement.\n\n***print()***: does not add a new line after the printed statement.",
