        "description": "**General Support:** As a teacher your role is primarily to support students as they make their way through the tutorial. Here are a few tips that should help students regardless of the level they're working on\r\n\r\n* **Collaborate with Neighbors:** Encourage students to check in with a neighbor when they're getting stuck. Since this tutorial includes videos and students may be wearing headphones it can get easy to \"go into a bubble\". Help break those barriers by actively pairing students if they seem like they need help. Depending on the age and ability of your students, you might consider formally breaking your class into pairs to complete the tutorial using [pair programming](https://youtu.be/vgkahOzFH2Q).  \r\n* **Read the Instructions:** The instructions usually provide helpful tips on how to complete the level. Before completing a level for a student ensure they've actually looked closely at the target image and read all the text there.\r\n* ![](https://curriculum.code.org/media/uploads/hint.png){: height='35px'}**Stuck? Look for hints:** Each level includes a hint with further details about how to pass the level. If students are trying to pass puzzles as quickly as possible, they might find they just need to wait a certain amount of time for all of the code to play out before moving on. Many levels contain a second hint with suggestions of ways to get even more creative by extending the task.\r\n* **Move On and Come Back:** Sometimes students will benefit more from coming back to a tricky level. All levels are independent of one another, though they do rely to some degree on previously introduced concepts.\r\n* **Take your time and experiment.** Even though the first couple levels tell students exactly what they need to do to pass, they should also feel free to try out their own ideas.",

Connect it inside the `setup` block.\r\n* You have now written your first program. Make sure to press Run to see what happens. You should hear music and see a character start to move in the display area.\r\n\r\n#### Level 2\r\n\r\n* Levels 2-3 are about making the dance interactive. \r\n* The green blocks are event blocks. These blocks start a new sequence of code and do not need to be connected inside the `setup` block. \r\n* Connecting the purple block under the green event block allows you to make the character perform a dance by pressing the orange arrow buttons or keys on your keyboard.\r\n* Make sure to press the arrow buttons after pressing Run or the dancer(s) won’t move.\r\n\r\n#### Level 3\r\n\r\n* Make sure to bring out a second purple `do once` block. You should have a `bears do once` block and a `cats do once` block in your workspace. Both should be connected to a green `when pressed` event block.\r\n* Make sure to press the arrow buttons after pressing Run or the dancers won’t move.\r\n\r\n#### Level 4\r\n\r\n* Levels 4-5 are about synchronizing the dance to the music. \r\n* The `after measures` event blocks also start a new sequence of code and should not be connected inside the `setup` block.\r\n* Connecting the purple `do forever` block under the green `after measures` event block should make the character perform a dance move after the number of measures you indicate.\r\n* The `do forever` block works differently from the `do once` blocks seen in the previous levels.\r\n\r\n#### Level 5\r\n\r\n* Make sure to bring out a second green event block.  You should have a `after 4 measures` block and a `after 6 measures` block in your workspace. Both should have purple block connected underneath.\r\n\r\n#### Level 6\r\n\r\n* Level 6 is about creating groups of dancers quickly.\r\n* Use the new block provided into the toolbox to create a set of smaller dancers.\r\n*You should also use the normal `make a new` block to create a larger “lead” dancer.\r\n* Many students will be familiar with the idea that you can make something seem to be further away by drawing it a smaller scale. In the next level you’ll be able to fine tune this effect.\r\n\r\n#### Level 7\r\n\r\n* Levels 7-9 are about adjusting the properties (e.g. size, color) of the dancers.\r\n* It is important to make sure that the teal `set` block is placed somewhere in the program *after* the dancers have been created. To solve this puzzle, place a `set size` block anywhere in your program and use it to change the size of some of your dancers. \r\n* Dancers created as a group have a default size of 30. Other dancers have a default size of 100.\r\n\r\n#### Level 8\r\n\r\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the `set tint to (color)` block after you have made the dancers in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the `setup` area of your program will have no effect.",

Otherwise, the dancer will just perform the set move repeatedly.\r\n* Note that the **code students write in this level is not checked for correctness**. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Students should feel free to experiment with their code in ways that are interesting to them. Click the “Finish” button to move on.\r\n* Making new dancers inside the `every 2 measures` block will cause your program to create multiple identical dancers at the same location(s) and may lead to unintended consequences!\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Level 10\r\n\r\n* This last level is very open-ended. The tutorial itself is designed to give students ample time to keep working on their own dance.\r\n* **Encourage Sharing:** If students have cell phones with a data plan they can quickly text a link to their projects to their own phone or a friend's. If your school policy allows it, encourage them to do so here.\r\n* **Encourage Creativity:** Creativity is important throughout this lesson, but this is true here more than anywhere else! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>2018 Tutorial - [View on Code Studio](https://studio.code.org/s/dance)</summary>\r\n\r\n#### Level 1\r\n\r\n* Drag the red `make a new` block from the toolbox on the left to the workspace on the right.

In this level, you'll create this effect by making the two dancers on the ends smaller.\r\n* It is important to make sure that the teal `set` block is placed somewhere in the program *after* the dancer has been created. To solve this puzzle, place a `set backup_dancer2 size to 50` block somewhere under the `make a new robot called backup_dancer2` block.\r\n\r\n#### Level 8\r\n\r\n* As with the previous level, make sure to only use the `set tint to (color)` block after you have the made the dancer in your program. For example, placing it as the first step in the `setup` area of your program will have no effect.\r\n\r\n#### Level 9\r\n\r\n* Computer science allows to process input information into interesting types of output. In this level, students can explore how a dancer's properties can be updated automatically based on the actual sound of the music."

Encourage students to be creative and explore the new blocks that are introduced. From this point on student code is **not checked for correctness** in order to encourage experimentation instead of solving a specific task.\r\n\r\n#### Level 10-11\r\n\r\n* These levels are about making the dance interactive. Try out the new `when pressed` event to make the dancers respond to key presses.\r\n* You can use the arrow keys on your computer keyboard or click the orange buttons under the display area.\r\n* Note that the **code students write in these levels is not checked for correctness**. This means they will always pass the level, even if they do not change the program. Encourage students to determine for themselves whether the code is doing what they expect before moving on.\r\n\r\n#### Level 12\r\n\r\n* The top six blocks in this tool box look familiar but all work in a different way. Instead of creating or controlling one dancer, they work with groups of dancers.\r\n* Like the previous levels, **code is not checked for correctness here**. Students should feel free to experiment with groups in ways that are interesting to them.\r\n\r\n#### Level 13\r\n\r\n* This last level is very open-ended. The tutorial itself is designed to give students ample time to keep working on their own dance.\r\n* **Encourage Sharing:** If students have cell phones with a data plan they can quickly text a link to their projects to their own phone or a friend's. If your school policy allows it, encourage them to do so here.\r\n* **Encourage Creativity:** Creativity is important throughout this lesson, but this is true here more than anywhere else! \r\n\r\n</details>"
