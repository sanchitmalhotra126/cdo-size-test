# This yaml file describes the configuration for
# gatekeeper.  Here is how a typical feature would
# be defined:
#
# <feature name>:
# - rule: <descripion of what rule does>
#    where: (optional)
#      user_id: 2
#      script_id: 2
#    value: <boolean>
#
# So for example if I wanted to turn the "milestone" feature
# off for all scripts except for script_id 38 I would do the following
#
# milestone:
#   - rule: Turn off for all users
#     value: false
#   - rule: Turn on for Trevor
#     where:
#       script_id: 38
#     value: true
#
#

milestone:
  - rule: Turn off for all users
    value: false
  - rule: Turn on for Trevor
    where:
      script_id: 38
    value: true

feature2:
  - rule: Turn on for all users
    value: true
