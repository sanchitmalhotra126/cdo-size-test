  Given I create a teacher named "Project_Czar"
  And I give user "Project_Czar" project validator permission
  And I remove featured projects from the gallery

Scenario: Published Projects Show In Recency Order
  Then I make a playlab project named "Older Published"
  Then I publish the project
  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/projects/public"
  Then I wait until element ".project_card" is in the DOM
  And I wait until the first ".ui-project-name" contains text "Older Published"
  Then I make a playlab project named "Newer Published"
  Then I publish the project
  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/projects/public"
  Then I debug element ".ui-project-name:eq(0)" text content
  Then I debug element ".ui-project-name:eq(1)" text content
  Then I debug element ".ui-project-name:eq(2)" text content
  Then I debug element ".ui-project-name:eq(3)" text content

  Then I wait until element ".project_card" is in the DOM
  Then I wait until element ".ui-project-name" is in the DOM
  Then I wait until the first ".ui-project-name" contains text "First Featured"
