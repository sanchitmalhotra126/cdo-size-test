Feature: Dropdowns work as expected

Background:
  Given I am on "http://studio.code.org/flappy/1?noautoplay=true"

Scenario: Drag a dropdown and select a different option.
  When I rotate to landscape
  And I wait for the page to fully load
  And I drag the play sound block to offset "200, 100"
  And I press dropdown number 2
  Then the Google Blockly dropdown is visible
  Then I select item 9 from the dropdown
  And I wait for 1 seconds
  Then the Google Blockly dropdown is hidden
  And the dropdown field has text "crash â–¾"
