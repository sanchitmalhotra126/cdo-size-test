# Dashboard UI Tests

Automated UI tests for the dashboard.

## Setup

### On your machine: Chrome webdriver

This is the best option for rapid iteration while writing a new test. ChromeDriver will run your tests in a new window on your machine.

1. [Download the chromedriver](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)
2. Start the chromedriver in the background (or a separate window): `/path/to/your/downloaded/chromedriver &`
3. `cd` to the directory of this README.
4. `bundle install`
5. `rbenv rehash`
6. `./runner.rb -l -m -d localhost.studio.code.org:3000 -p localhost.code.org:3000`
  - `-l` makes it use the chromedriver
  - `-m` maximizes the window on startup
  - `-d` sets the test domain for dashboard
  - `-p` sets the test domain for pegasus
  - a window will pop up in the background in which you can watch the tests happen
7. In a separate window, run `tail -f *.log` to watch the results of your tests
  - `-f` streams the log in your shell, so it will be updated as new lines are written

### With remote browsers: Browserstack

Running tests remotely on [Browserstack automate](http://browserstack.com/automate) lets you review results, view visual logs of test runs and even watch live video of your tests running on different browsers in real-time.

We are currently **limited to 2 concurrent test runs**, so you and one other person can be running your test suites at the same time. Browserstack shows how many tests are running at the top left. If it says 2/2, wait or ask for one to free up.

#### Credentials

BrowserStack requires credentials to be set in the environment first.

Ideally, use your own credentials from https://www.browserstack.com/accounts/automate.

```
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME='your username'
export BROWSERSTACK_AUTHKEY='your authkey'
```

Code.org shared credentials can be used by placing the dashboard directory directly within the `website-ci` repository.

#### Testing your local site copy: Browserstack tunnel

1. Download the [command line Browserstack client](http://www.browserstack.com/local-testing#command-line)
2. `/path/to/your/downloaded/BrowserStackLocal $BROWSERSTACK_AUTHKEY localhost,3000,0`
3. `./runner.rb -d localhost:3000 -t`

You can now watch your tests run at the [Browserstack automate page](https://www.browserstack.com/automate).  The tests will run on each of the browser/OS configurations specified in [browsers.json](https://github.com/code-dot-org/dashboard/blob/finished/test/ui/browsers.json).

#### Troubleshooting

We don't know why some scenarios are failing on iPad3 and iPhone5S.  The error that appears is "Unable to communicate to node (Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError)".  A workaround is to tag those scenarios `@no_mobile`.

## Options

Here are some example command line options.  Run `./runner.rb --help` for a full list.

Run with a specific OS version, browser, browser version, and feature:

```
./runner.rb -o 7 -b chrome -v 31 -f features/simpledrag.feature

OR

./runner.rb -c Chrome31Win7 -f features/simpledrag.feature
```

Run with a specific domain substituted in place of the default, tunneling from BrowserStack into local machine:

```
./runner.rb -d localhost:3000 -t
```

Note that tunneling to local machine from BrowserStack requires the tool at http://www.browserstack.com/local-testing#command-line.

Run against local Chrome webdriver instead of BrowserStack:

```
./runner.rb -l
```

Note that this requires a local webdriver running on port 9515, such as Chromedriver at http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html.

Run using real mobile browsers, not emulators, using BrowserStack's beta feature:

```
./runner.rb -r
```

## Tips

- If you're new to [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/), read about [Cucumber scenarios](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Feature-Introduction), especially the keywords [Given When Then](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Given-When-Then).
- When debugging test scripts, it can be helpful to add pauses, such as: `And I wait for 5 seconds`.
