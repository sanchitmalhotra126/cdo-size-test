 - Match identical portions of similar phrases to match patterns.
 - Identify differences in similar phrases and abstract them out.","With nothing but paper and markers, students will learn the four steps of computational thinking. After a brief introduction, students should be split into groups where they will have to create directions for other students to draw a specific monster (from a catalog of pre-selected monsters). The entire task must be decomposed, then teams will analyze all monsters in the catalog for patterns, abstract similar details from the monsters, then use that information to create an algorithm (directions) for another team to draw a certain monster. Teams will then switch algorithms with another group and draw the monster based on what that algorithm indicates. Is the drawing what the original team intended?",,https:,studio.code.org,unplugged,unplug2.pdf,,,,,,,

If we want to have any chance of making something creative, useful, and clever, then we need to be willing to attack hard problems even if it means failing a few times before we succeed. In this lesson, students will be building a structure with common materials. The structure will be tested on its ability to hold a textbook for more than ten seconds. Most students will not get this right the first time, but it's important they push through and keep trying.","<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zrtHt3bBmQ&list=PLIChyVOpASG3UTHeoU-z6GuwyAFIFfpFj"" target=""_new"">Class Dojo: Growth Mindset videos</a><a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/educator/reference-for-coaches/how-to/a/growth-mindset-lesson-plan"" target=""_new"">Khan Academy: Growth Mindset</a>",https:,curriculum.code.org,csf-18,coursec,1,,,,,,

- Describe at least one reason why they will choose to be persistent in the face of frustration, rather than giving up.
","When students run into a barrier while answering a question or working on a project, it’s so easy for them to get frustrated and give up. This lesson will introduce students to the idea that frustration can be an important part of learning. Here, frustration is presented as a step in the creative process, rather than a sign of failure.

",Abstraction is one of the most important skills for a computer scientist to understand. It simplifies problems and prevents unnecessary repetition. A good coder uses abstraction just about every time she creates a program. This activity will have your students analyze stories for differences so that they can abstract them away. Those abstracted stories become templates for fun and crazy new ones.,,https:,code.org,curriculum,course4,5,Teacher,,,,"<a href=""https://www.code.org/curriculum/course4/5/Key-Activity5-MadGlibs.pdf"" target=""_new"">Activity Answer Key</a><br/>
