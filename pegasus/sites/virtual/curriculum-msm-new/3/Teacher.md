# Teaching Guide

## Getting Started


### <a name="Vocab"></a> 1) Vocabulary
This lesson has two new and important words:<br/>

- **Retangle of Evaluation** - a diagram of the structure of an expression (arithmetic or code)
- **Evaluate** - perform the computation in an expression, producing an answer
- **Expression** - a computation written in the rules of some language (such as arithmetic, code, or a Rectangle of Evaluation)
- **Function** - a mathematical object that takes in some inputs and produces an output
- **Programming Language** - a set of rules for writing code that a computer can evaluate
- **Value** - a specific piece of data, like 5 or "hello"

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 2) Introduction
Math is a language, just like English, Spanish, or any other language. We use nouns, like "bread", "tomato", "mustard" and "cheese" to describe physical objects. Math has values, like the numbers 1, 2 or 3, to describe quantities. Humans also use verbs like "toast", "slice", "spread" and "melt" to describe operations on these nouns. Mathematics has functions like addition and subtraction, which are operations performed on numbers. Just as you can "slice piece of bread", a person can also "add four and five".

A mathematical expression is like a sentence: it’s an instruction for doing something. The expression 4+5 tells us to add 4 and 5. To evaluate an expression, we follow the instructions in the expression. The expression 4+5 evaluates to 9.

Sometimes, we need multiple expressions to accomplish a task. If you were to write instructions for making a sandwich, it would matter very much which came first: melting the cheese, slicing the bread, spreading the mustard, etc. The order of functions matters in mathematics, too. If someone says "four plus two minus one", they could mean several things:

- Add four and two, then subtract one: (4+2)−1
- Add four to the result of subtracting one from two: 4+(2−1)

Depending on which way you read the expression, you might have very different results! This is a problem, because we often use math to share calculations between people. For example, you and your cell phone company should agree upfront on how much you will pay for sending text messages and making calls. Different results might mean that your bill looks wrong. We avoid problems by agreeing on the order in which to use the different operations in an expression. There are two ways to do this:

1. We can all agree on an order to use
2. We can add detail to expressions that indicate the order

<img src="pyramid.png" style="float: right" />
Mathematicians didn’t always agree on the order of operations, but now we have a common set of rules for how to evaluate expressions. When evaluating an expression, we begin by applying the operations written at the top of the pyramid (multiplication and division). Only after we have completed all of those operations can we move down to the lower level. If both operations are present (as in 4+2−1), we read the expression from left to right, applying the operations in the order in which they appear.

## Activity: Calc Rectangles of Evaluation
### <a name="Activity1"></a> 3) Online Puzzles

The programming language you are going to learn uses Rectangles of Evaluation to visually represent mathematical functions. Each block of code is either a Function, or a Value - head to [MSM Stage 2](http://studio.code.org/s/msm/stage/2/puzzle/1) in Code Studio to get started programming.
