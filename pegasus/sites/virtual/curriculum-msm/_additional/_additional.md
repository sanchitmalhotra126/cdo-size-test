<!-- # Middle School CS in Math -->

Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.BootstrapWorld.org) to offer their  introductory curriculum which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. The nine units focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems - all within the context of video game design. By shifting classwork from abstract pencil-and-paper problems to a series of relevant programming problems, Bootstrap demonstrates how algebra applies in the real world, using an exciting, hands-on approach to create something cool. 

At the end of the nine units, students will have a completed workbook filled with word problems, notes, and math challenges, as well as a video game of their own design to share with friends and family. 

Bootstrap is aligned to Common Core Standards for Mathematics. This alignment makes it possible to integrate Bootstrap into the classroom smoothly. Bootstrap is also a model implementation of Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice, offering explicit pedagogical recommendation across all eight practice standards. Bootstrap also satisfies several of the CSTA (Computer Science Teacher's Association) standards across levels 1 (grades K-6) and 2 (grades 6-9).

## Curriculum Documents

<!--

The Bootstrap [curriculum](/curriculum/msm) includes nine units; each consists of five or six lessons that augment educational outcomes of traditional math instruction to include computational thinking within engaging activities.

**Unit 1: Videogames and Coordinate Planes**: Students discuss the components of their favorite video games, and discover that they can be reduced to a series of coordinates. They then explore coordinates in Cartesian space, and identify the coordinates for the characters in a game at various points in time. [Download the lesson](/msm/1)

**Unit 2: Contracts, Strings and Images**: Students are introduced to a set-mapping representation for functions, in which the function object exists as a means of translating points from a Domain into a Range. [Download the lesson](/msm/2)

**Unit 3: Introduction to Definitions**: Students are introduced to the Definitions window, and learn the syntax for defining values of various types. They are also introduced to the syntax of defining functions and creating examples. [Download the lesson](/msm/3)

**Unit 4: The Design Recipe**: Students practice the Design Recipe by applying it to simple problems. [Download the lesson](/msm/4)

**Unit 5: Game Animation**: Students define functions that map attributes of their game from one frame to the next, allowing them to move their dangers, targets, and projectiles. [Download the lesson](/msm/5)

**Unit 6: Teaching Functions to Compare** Students discover Boolean types, and use them to create programs that test values, and then model scenarios using these programs. [Download the lesson](/msm/6)

**Unit 7: Piecewise Functions**: Students use geometry and conditional branching to move their player characters in response to key-presses. [Download the lesson](/msm/7)

**Unit 8: The Distance Formula**: Students derive, discuss, and prove the Pythagorean theorem, then use this theorem—in conjunction with Booleans—to detect collisions in their games. [Download the lesson](/msm/8)

**Unit 9: Prepping for Launch**: Students will edit game details and prepare for their Launch Party! [Download the lesson](/msm/9)

**Supplemental Lessons**: For teachers looking for additional exercises, we have compiled many activities for students to go deeper into the material to create more advanced projects. [Download the lesson](/msm/Supplemental)
