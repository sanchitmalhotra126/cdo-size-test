# Course D Markdown

Might want to play with size of text, but relative sizing is how I want it for now

### Markdown for embedded artist

#### Ready... Set... Draw!

Here's an example of a drawing that you're about to create yourself! 

Run through it one or two times so that you know what to expect.

**Some fun punny things for Frozen**

- Freeze! Here's an example...
- Do you wanna build a snowflake? ...
- Cool off with this new drawing ...

### Markdown for embedded Play Lab

#### Ready... Set... Play!

Here's an example of a game that you're about to create yourself! 

Play through it one or two times so that you know what to expect.

### Markdown for concept textbook pages

All in one place for now, will be split up at horizontal lines for each concept

------

1. Algorithms

------

### In this lesson...

Have you ever wanted to tell someone exactly what to do? Do they always listen to you?

Today, you'll be telling a machine what to do, step by step- and it will listen!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml>when run</xml><xml>move forward</xml>

------

### You just learned "algorithms"!

**An algorithm is just a list of steps to finish a task**. The fun thing about algorithms is that you get to decide what happens, step by step. 

When you write an algorithm for a machine, this is called a **program**. 

#### Words to Know

Algorithm

- A list of steps to finish a task

Program

- An algorithm that has been coded into something that can be run by a machine

#### Up Next

Have you ever wondered how you could get your character to move when you press the arrow keys?



------

2. Events

------

### In this lesson...

Think about your favorite video game. Does the game play itself when you press "play"? 

What if you wanted to make different code run when something new happens? Let's find out!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml>When left arrow</xml> <xml>When actor 1 touches actor 2</xml>

------

### You just learned "events"!

**An event is an action that causes something to happen.**

Events help us write programs that can respond to different actions. 

#### Words to Know

Event

- An action that causes something to happen

#### Up Next

Have you ever wanted to repeat something over and over? Next, you will learn an easy way to do that!



------

4. Loops/Nested Loops

------

### In this lesson...

How would you move your character forward **5** times? Easy- just drag out **5** move forward blocks. 

What if you want your character to move forward **5,000** times? How long would it take you to drag out **5,000** blocks? 

You will learn an easy way to do this!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml>repeat ??? times</xml>

------

### You just learned "loops"!

**A loop is the action of doing something over and over again.** Another word for doing something again is **repeat**.

Sometimes you even put a loop inside another loop- those are called **nested loops**!

#### Words to Know

Loop

- The action of doing something over and over again

Repeat

- Do something again

Nested Loop

- A loop within a loop

#### Up Next

Be careful! Some bugs might crawl their way into your program.



------

6. Debugging

------

### In this lesson...

When most people think about bugs, they think about creepy crawly things. In computer science, bugs aren't alive, but they can still be tricky.

The puzzles in this lesson look done! **But wait**- they don't seem to be working yet. 

------

### You just learned about "bugs"!

**A bug is something that goes wrong.** It is an error in a program. When you find and fix those errors, you are **debugging** a problem. 

You have to practice **persistence**, another word for not giving up, in order to find and fix all the bugs.

#### Words to Know

Bug

- Part of a program that does not work correctly

Debugging

- Finding and fixing problems in an algorithm or program

Persistence

- Not giving up

#### Up Next

Have you ever wanted to repeat something over and over? Ever wish there was an easy way to do that? Your wait is almost over!

7. While Loops

---

### In this lesson...

If you were in a room full of your favorite food, what would you do? *While* there is food left,  you would keep eating it, right? 

Today you will learn how to use this idea in your programs!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml>While there is a pile</xml> or <xml>While path ahead</xml>

---

### You just learned "while loops"!

**A while loop is a loop that continues to repeat until something happens**. 

They are really helpful when you don't know exactly how many times a loop should repeat!

#### Words to Know

While Loop

* A loop that continues to repeat while a condition is true.

#### Up Next

Have you ever heard someone say "under one condition"? What does it mean?



------

8. Conditionals

------

### In this lesson...

What does "under one condition" mean? It means that *if* you follow the rules, or *condition*, something will happen next.

You can use this idea in computer science too! *If* there is a flower, get nectar from it. *While* your character can move forward, keep moving forward.

Let's get started!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml> If at flower </xml>

<xml>While path ahead</xml>

------

### You just learned "conditionals"!

**A *conditional* is a statement that only runs under a certain condition.** 

A *condition* is a statement that a program checks to see if it is true or false. If true, an action is taken. Otherwise, the action is ignored.

Conditionals are very useful in computer science. They are used in websites, video games, apps- everywhere!

#### Words to Know

Condition

- A statement that a program checks to see if it is true or false

Conditionals

- Statements that only run under certain conditions
