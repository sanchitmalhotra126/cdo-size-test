## The Algebra Inside Your Videogame: Computer Science in Math

Many students love videogames, but how many really understand what it takes to make one? In Code.org Computer Science in Algebra, we pull back the veil on Computer Science and reveal to students the underlying fundamental math that makes everything tick.

Using an easy to learn block based language, students will learn to create images, animations, and interactive videogames that are driven by algebraic functions. Through the process of developing their videogames, students will discover how computer programmers use the coordinate plane, algebraic functions, and logic to create the games that they love.

Code.org partnered with Bootstrap to develop an exciting and engaging curriculum that allows students to discover that is built on proven pedagogy and practices.

## Functional Programming _is_ Math!

The Functional Programming paradigm used in this course will look very familiar to algebra teachers, becuase the language operates just like algebraic functions do!

## It's more than just Coding

Algebra goes beyond just _solving for x_, and Code.org CS in math goes beyond this _writing code_. Through learning to program, students will also practive problem decomposition, clear communication through documentation. testing their own functions against example cases and input/output tables.
Code.org’s K-5 curriculum aligns to [CSTA Computer Science Standards](http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/K12Standards.html) and [ISTE](http://www.iste.org/STANDARDS) standards, while some lessons also integrate national [Math](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/), [English Language Arts](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/), and [Science](http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards) standards.


The use of *Computer Science Themes* scaffolds the development of ideas and recognizes the continual construction of knowledge:

- Algorithms
- Data
- Abstraction
- Computing Practice and Programming (Use of computational tools)
- Computers and Communication Devices (Elements of computing devices and networks)
- Community, Global, and Ethical Impacts

Across the entire K-5 curriculum, students will develop the skills of a computer scientist through the development of *Computational Thinking Practices*:

- Creativity
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Persistence
- Problem Solving

## Technology Requirements

#### A computing device and an Internet connection. 
We work hard to build an environment that is supported by all modern web browsers on desktops and mobile devices, but you'll have the most success with an up-to-date browser (IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari). 

Our instructional videos may be affected depending on your school's internet filters. If YouTube is blocked at your school, our video player will attempt to use our non-YouTube player instead. For more details about the IT requirements for accessing and playing our embedded videos, see our [IT requirements](http://code.org/educate/it) page.

We’ve also made all our videos available for download. During the tutorials, there is also a green download link for each video, allowing students to download individual videos. If all fails, there is a “Show Notes” tab that provides a storyboard equivalent of the video.



## Getting Help

The curriculum is completely free for anyone, anywhere to teach. You can get support by visiting [support.code.org](http://support.code.org). If you are a teacher and you'd like to attend a free training on our K-5 Computer Science curriculum, look [here](http://code.org/k5) for a workshop near you.
