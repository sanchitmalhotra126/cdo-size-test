- [Key Code Reference](../docs/worksheets/keycode_ref.pdf) (in the student workbook)

## Getting Started

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 1) Introduction

Remind students of the game they played in the last stage, what were some of the tricky elements of constructing a good conditional statement?

- Order matters (the first condition in the list to return true wins!).
- Write clear and explicit conditions.
- Use the else clause as a catch all for conditions that you don't expect or can't write explicit conditions for.
- All conditionals must have at least on condition and an else statement, you can add or remove further condition as using the blue buttons.

At the end of this stage, students will return to their Big Game to complete the [`update-player`](../docs/worksheets/update_player.pdf) function. This function contains a conditional that will check which key was pressed (using key codes), and move the player up or down accordingly. We've provided a [key code reference](../docs/worksheets/keycode_ref.pdf) for students in case they wish to use keys other than the default up (38) and down (40) arrows.

# Lesson Tip

Be sure to check students’ Contracts and EXAMPLEs during this exercise, especially when it’s time for them to circle and label what changes between examples. This is the crucial step in the Design Recipe where they should discover the need for `cond`.

[/tip]

Students can also add more advanced movement, by using what they've learned about boolean functions. Here are some ideas:

- Warping: instead of having the player’s y-coordinate change by adding or subtracting, replace it with a Number to have the player suddenly appear at that location. (For example, hitting the "c" key causes the player to warp back to the center of the screen, at y=200.)
- Boundary-detection Change the condition for moving up so that the player only moves up if key=up AND player-y is less than 400. Likewise, change the condition for down to also check that player-y is greater than 0.
- Wrapping: Add a condition (before any of the keys) that checks to see if the player’s y-coordinate is above the screen (y > 400). If it is, have the player warp to the bottom (y=0). Add another condition so that the player warps back up to the top of the screen if it moves below the bottom.
- Challenge: Have the player hide when the "h" key is pressed, only to re-appear when it is pressed again!
