If you haven’t already, watch our [how-to video and guide](http://hourofcode.com/us/resources/how-to). I’ve answered the most common questions below, but [read our FAQs](http://hourofcode.com/us#faq) for more. 

## The Hour of Code keeps growing - Apple takeover and 65,000 events!
Today Apple announced [Hour of Code workshops in every store *worldwide*](http://www.apple.com/retail/code/)! And 12,000 new organizers signed up classrooms this week. Can we reach 100M students this year?


Thanks for your support,

If your whole school is participating - hooray! If not, you have 1 more day to recruit a fellow teacher to join you. :-)

#### Answers to common questions:

**Do students need accounts to do the Hour of Code?**<br />
No! (follow-on tutorials may require signup to save student progress)

**Will YouTube videos work in my school?**<br />
Code.org’s videos fall back to a non-youtube player, and include a download-link. KhanAcademy videos also work if YouTube is blocked. We’re not sure about others.

**What computers/devices/hardware do I need?**<br />
The ideal is individual devices (tablets or desktops), plus headphones for the kids to enjoy the videos. You can also show videos on a shared projector. And kids can program in pairs, or watch a teacher coding on a smartscreen. There are unplugged activities if you have no devices.  If you are using Code.org tutorials, [check out the IT requirements](http://code.org/educate/it).

**Which activity should I start with /  Where’s the Anna/Elsa activity?**<br />
All our curated activities are [here](http://code.org/learn), and you’re free to invent your own. For all ages, we recommend starting with a beginner tutorial (such as the ones with Angry Birds or the more-advanced Anna & Elsa one). A high school student should be able to finish one of these in 30 minutes and can then try a more advanced tutorial in JavaScript, such as KhanAcademy or CodeHS, or other options.
