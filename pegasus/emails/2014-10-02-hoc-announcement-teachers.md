### Calling all teachers. Worldwide.

Computer science is foundational for all students today. Yet 90% of schools don't teach it. Last December, 15 million students tried computer science in one week, thanks to educators like you! Since then, over 40 million students have tried the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com).

### What's an Hour of Code?

It's an introduction to computer science designed to show that anyone can learn the basics. Code.org provides hour-long tutorials featuring Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Angry Birds, and Plants vs. Zombies â€” for your computer, tablet, smartphone, or with no computer at all!

### No experience needed from teachers and students

We owe it to today's students to start with one hour. Let's make history.
