Megan first tried computer science when her 6th grade class did the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/). She never thought about coding before, but now she’s taking classes at a local university, and reimagining her whole future! 

With your support, we’ve introduced 45 million students to an Hour of Code in 180 countries. 

**Every** student should have the opportunity Megan did. That’s why Code.org hase’ve launched an ambitious crowdfunding campaign to make this vision a reality. I'm asking for your help to go further. **[Donate now](http://igg.me/at/hourofcode/x/9005891)**

### Only $180,000 away from breaking the record
This week, foundations set up by Code.org major supporters Mark Zuckerberg, John Doerr, and Rich Barton generously donated over $1 millon to our campaign. We’re now close to becoming the largest campaign in Indiegogo history!

Please [help us break the record](http://igg.me/at/hourofcode/x/9005891) and raise enough funds to introduce 100 million students to one Hour of Code. We're halfway to our overall goal!

### Every dollar matched: unlock funds that double your impact
Generous donors have offered to match **every dollar you donate. Your donation will unlock this investment in our children’s future.** Plus, we have fun perks to thank you in return!

Every child deserves the chance to learn foundational 21st century skills.
