## Add your classroom to our map of schools teaching computer science

We want to highlight all the amazing work that teachers are doing at their schools and in their classrooms, so if you're planning on teaching computer science *on an ongoing basis*, whether with Code.org's Code Studio or any other program, please make sure your classroom or school is listed on our map at [http://code.org/learn/local](http://code.org/learn/local). If your school or classroom isn't listed already, please fill out [this form](http://code.org/schools/new) to add it to the map!

## Student Demographic Information (U.S. only)

Part of [Code.org's mission](http://code.org/about) is to expand participation in computer science by women and underrepresented students of color. We're collecting demographic information on students who are using Code Studio, and we need your help! [**Click here to fill out this 3 question survey.**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HTPGR8J)
