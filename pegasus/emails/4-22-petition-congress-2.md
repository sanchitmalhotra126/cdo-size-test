subject: "Join Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates to support computer science"

Despite the growing support for computer science, most of America’s schools don’t teach this subject.  It’s become foundational to every field of study and leads to the best-paying jobs, yet most students won’t get a chance at these jobs because computer science isn’t taught in their school.

This is a problem we can only solve with ***your*** help. 

###Join leaders in asking Congress to support computer science.
Soon Congress will decide whether to support the movement for K-12 computer science in your local schools. Congress is considering a bipartisan funding proposal to expand K-12 computer science (without growing the Federal budget), to give every student the ***opportunity*** to learn. 

This week, America's top leaders [join forces to ask Congress](https://www.change.org/p/give-every-student-the-opportunity-to-learn-computer-science-in-school) to support this idea. Tech titans Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos join state governors and K-12 education leaders, along with CEOs of the largest retailers, airlines, banks, hotels, and manufacturers, in an unprecedented bipartisan call to action.

###This movement needs your help.
Polls show 90% of Americans agree on this, but your representatives must hear **from you**. 

[See the amazing list of leaders supporting this issue, and add your name too](https://www.change.org/computerscience). 

Together we can change the world, for all our children.

Thank you,
