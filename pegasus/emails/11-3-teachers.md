Hour of Code organizer,

When you signed up for the Hour of Code, you asked for help connecting with a tech volunteer to inspire your students and introduce them to a world of possibilities that come with learning to code.

### You can now search for a tech volunteer in your area

1) Visit our volunteer map to find volunteers and learn more about them.

2) Contact a volunteer through our online form. Share more details about your Hour of Code event and your volunteer will respond to you directly if they’re able to help out.
