###The Hour of Code is here in Latin America!
You are one of the hundreds of teachers in Latin America empowering more than ten million students to try an hour of computer science. Thank you for joining us in this movement!

Partners from across the region are joining forces to support the Hour of Code, including Fundación País Digital in Chile, Argentina’s Universidad Nacional de Córdoba and the Vice President of the Dominican Republic.
