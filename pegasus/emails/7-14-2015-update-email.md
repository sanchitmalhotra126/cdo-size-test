We want to update you on our efforts to bring computer science to every student in every school. A lot has happened in the last 6 months at Code.org. Marking the 2-year anniversary of our very first hire this month, here’s more on our progress:
</p>
<h2>
1) Broadening participation in computer science and increasing diversity</h2>
<p>
46% of active coders on our platform <a href="https://studio.code.org/">Code Studio</a> are female. 37% are black or Hispanic.</p>

<p>
The College Board recently reported early AP exam stats, and <a href="http://blog.code.org/post/123032125688/apcs-2015">computer science is now the fastest-growing AP exam of the 2010s</a>. Amazing! But still only taught in 5% of US high schools.
</p>
<h2>
2) Creating fantastic online curriculum and spreading it to teachers</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://studio.code.org/">Code Studio</a> now has 5.9M student accounts, with over 2M girls signed up. 10% of all US students in grades K-8 have accounts. 10,000 new students sign up each day and 10,000 new teachers sign up each month. Overall, our growth is driven by teacher-to-teacher referrals, boosted by the <a href="http://hourofcode.com/">Hour of Code</a>.

<p>
<b>Introducing App Lab</b></p>
<p>
Today, we also unveiled a preview of <a href="https://code.org/educate/csp">our new high school course, Computer Science Principles</a>, which includes a new tool for making and sharing apps: <a href="http://code.org/applab">App Lab</a>.<br>
</p>

<h2>3) Training teachers and adding computer science to schools</h2>
<p>
In May, we announced a <a href="https://code.org/college-board">landmark alliance with the College Board</a>, to bring our courses to more schools and help more diverse students access computer science, when they may never try it otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Code.org now has 71 school district partners, and 10,000 teachers have attended our training workshops to begin teaching CS. We’re encouraged to see teachers give our workshops the highest ratings. 94% recommend it, 85% say it’s the best training they ever had. <b>Please help: <a href="http://code.org/k5">ask an elementary school teacher</a> you know to attend a workshop near you (at no cost!).

4) Advocacy gains accelerating
</h2>
<p>
In our first 2 years, our advocacy coalition helped 16 states adjust graduation policies to recognize computer science as an academic field, not just an elective. Now we’re helping states pass comprehensive policies to increase access to computer science.</p><p><b>In just the past 3 months:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Arkansas:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/arkansas-computer-science/">passed a law (plus funding) requiring every high school to teach CS</a></li>
<li><b>Washington state:&nbsp;</b><a href="http://blog.code.org/post/122951279913/wa-budget">allocated $40M to expand access to computer science</a></li>
<li><b>Maryland:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.code.org/post/121123281798/md">changed policies that should triple diversity in computer science</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
At the city level, <a href="http://www.sfusd.edu/en/news/current-news/2015-news-archive/06/board-approves-plans-to-expand-computer-science-curriculum-to-all-grades.html"><b>San Francisco</b> schools voted to bring computer science to every student in every grade</a></p>
