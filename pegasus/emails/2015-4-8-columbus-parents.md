Dear Columbus parent, 

Computer science can open up more doors for our children than any other discipline in today’s world. But a lot of schools still don’t even offer it. 

Help Code.org bring computer science courses to your school — at no cost to teachers or schools. Code.org has partnered with districts around Columbus to prepare teachers to offer computer science, for all levels — kindergarten through high school. 

### What can your children learn?

**Elementary school:** Short modules that students absolutely love<br />
**Middle school:** Computer science activities integrated into any algebra or science class<br />
**High school:** An inclusive, year-long introductory computer science course<br />

### How you can bring computer science to your child’s school:

- [Share this page](https://code.org/educate/columbus/) with your teacher or principal. Ask them to get involved. 
- Know a private school teacher? [Use this letter](https://code.org/promote/letter/)
- See [other ways to help](https://code.org/help/)
