Dear Code.org friends and fans,

I spent my holidays reflecting on the incredible momentum behind computer science — from hundreds of partners to tens of thousands of educators and schools and millions of students and parents.  

Most people who hear about Code.org see the glitz: the Hour of Code, celebrities, and marketing. Indeed, with the help of the [US President](http://youtu.be/AI_dayIQWV4) and other world leaders, [Anna & Elsa from Frozen](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/103042812198/frozen), and every [Apple](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/104341574918/apple) and [Microsoft](https://www.facebook.com/Code.org/photos/a.713452212084418.1073741855.309754825787494/716326561796983/) store, the Hour of Code beat even our wildest expectations.

## Beyond the Hour of Code
But education takes more than an hour. The Hour of Code is just a seed. The bulk of Code.org’s effort goes into follow-up: adding computer science to official curriculum. Here’s my summary of what we achieved in 2014, with your help.


## 1) Bringing fantastic online courses to classrooms 
We’ve developed [100 hours of follow-on curriculum](http://studio.code.org) that’s taught in 90,000 schools worldwide. With 4M students enrolled, it receives consistently positive feedback.
 

## 2) Partnering with school districts, training teachers

## 3) Addressing diversity by starting younger

## 4) Changing state policies to support computer science

## 5) International reach
