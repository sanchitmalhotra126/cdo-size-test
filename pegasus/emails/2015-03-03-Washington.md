Today over 50 [top business and education leaders](https://code.org/wahington) — from Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks to the Chamber of Commerce and University of Washington — join forces, [calling for legislation to expand computer science](https://code.org/washington) in schools throughout the state.

####Please, add your support — [Ask your reps to support change](http://www.congressweb.com/code/11)

Our state is considering a comprehensive policy that would establish education standards for computer science and match private funding to train teachers.

Right now there are 20,000 open computing jobs across all industries in Washington. These jobs are growing at 3x the state average. But 90% of schools don’t offer computer science. This is a problem we can solve.

Most importantly, **every** student today should have the opportunity to learn how technology works.

**[Ask your reps to support HB 1813](http://www.congressweb.com/code/11)**

In 2013, Washington led 15 other states to allow computer science to count for high school graduation. Today’s our chance to lead again.
