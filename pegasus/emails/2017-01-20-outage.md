Code Studio had some technical difficulties and any student progress from 9:19 - 10:33 am PST on Friday, January 20th was not saved. The site is back up and student progress is being saved again. 

Other impacts are listed below by course:

**Course 1-4, Accelerated Course, CS in Algebra, and Hour of Code Activities:**
Code and activities completed between 9:19 and 10:33 am PST were not saved. You’ll see your green progress dots filled in correctly for previous progress, but in the short-term, code written prior to today may not be visible on Code Studio. It’s *not* lost. It’s just in a different database. We’re urgently working to address this, and will soon have everything working smoothly again, but please be patient with us until we get there.

**CS Principles and CS Discoveries:**
Code and activities completed between 9:19 and 10:33 am PST were not saved. All other student work completed before and after this time has been saved and is appearing normally. 

**Some more technical details (yes, datatypes and binary limits matter):**
This morning, at 9:19 am PST, coding progress by students stopped saving on Code Studio, and the issue briefly brought the Code Studio site down. We brought the site back up shortly thereafter but student progress was still not being saved, and instead students saw an outdated message about the Hour of Code from December. 

As of 10:33 am PST, we re-enabled saving of progress by students, so everybody can continue coding and saving their progress, and the green dots correctly reflect past progress.  Unfortunately we couldn’t save any student code created during the 9:19 am - 10:33 am PST window. All other student work has been saved, but it’s not always visible to students. 

The way we store student coding activity is in a table that until today had a 32-bit index. What this means is that the database table could only store 4 billion rows of coding activity information. We didn’t realize we were running up to the limit, and the table got full. We have now made a *new* student activity table that is storing progress by students. With the new table, we are switching to a 64-bit index which will hold up to 18 quintillion rows of information. On the plus side, this new table will be able to store student coding information for millions of years. On the down side, until we’ve moved everything over to the new table, some students’ code from before today may temporarily not appear, so please be patient with us as we fix it.

We sincerely apologize for the disruption to your classroom and any inconvenience this may have caused. Thank you for using Code Studio. Our engineers are working hard to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.
