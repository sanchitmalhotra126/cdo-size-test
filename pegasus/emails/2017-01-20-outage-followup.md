We have an update on the technical issue that Code Studio experienced on the morning of January 20th. For more information on this morning’s issue read [the blog we posted](http://blog.code.org/post/156133016748/this-mornings-technical-difficulties-on-code).

Thank you for your patience as our team worked to resolve this issue. Students should now be able to access code written prior to today that may have not been showing up. This includes any games or artwork they saved to the Gallery section on the bottom of their studio.code.org page.

As a reminder, most student work completed during the Code Studio outage from 9:19 - 10:33 am PST on Friday, January 20th was not saved and unfortunately cannot be recovered. 

Thank you again for using Code Studio and for bearing with us as we addressed this issue. We know how hard our teachers work to put computer science in their classrooms, and we’re dedicated to supporting your efforts by providing the best learning platform possible. As always, if you ever run into any problems, please contact us at [support@code.org](mailto:support@code.org) so we can respond promptly to your feedback.
