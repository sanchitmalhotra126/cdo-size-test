You were one of the first 20,000 educators to attend a Code.org workshop. I hope you’re having fun with Code Studio in your classroom.

### Help us spread the word
Most workshop attendees ranked it the best professional development ever! If you had a good experience, *please* spread the word. (If you didn’t, reply with feedback. I can’t respond to every note, but we’ll read it.)
