### <%= header['subject'] %>

The Hour of Code just got a lot more *historic*. As [the Hour of Code nears](http://hourofcode.com) in the next few weeks, one lucky classroom will be selected to attend a very special, very exciting Hour of Code event in the nation’s capital — so special that the details are under wraps!

The winning students (and chaperones) will get an all-expenses-covered trip to Washington, D.C. to participate in a full day of mystery activities on Monday, December 8, to kick off Computer Science Education Week, when millions worldwide will try computer science for the first time.

### How to participate
If you want your class to experience this trip, make sure your classroom or school is registered for the  Hour of Code at [http://hourofcode.com](http://hourofcode.com/).
