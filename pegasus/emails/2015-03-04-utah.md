For the first time, Utah is considering comprehensive legislation that provides funding to expand computer science education throughout the state.

Most Utah schools aren’t offering computer science to students who use technology more than ever. The biggest problem? There just aren’t enough teachers prepared to teach computer science. This bill addresses exactly that.

Right now there are 5,000 open computing jobs across all industries in Utah. These jobs are growing at 3x the state average. But the vast majority of schools don’t teach it. This is a problem we can solve, with your help.

Most importantly, **every** young person today should have the opportunity to learn how technology works.
