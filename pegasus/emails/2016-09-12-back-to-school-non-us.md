<h3>Thank you for one awesome summer.</h3>

Thanks to educators like you, computer science is experiencing [record growth in schools](http://blog.code.org/post/150040749703/another-year-of-record-growth-for-ap-computer). The entire education community has rallied behind this new subject, and 2016-17 will be the biggest school year for computer science, ever. 

### New Code Studio features for your classroom, thanks to *your* feedback.

### For *any* classroom
- Encourage **pair programming** in your classroom! We improved the way Code Studio tracks student progress, even if 2 students use the same computer! [Check it out](http://teacherblog.code.org/post/147349807334/try-pair-programmingtrack-the-progress-of) and let us know how it’s working in your classroom. 

- Keep your CS Fundamentals class on track with ["Stage Extras"](http://teacherblog.code.org/post/149328400419/allow-your-students-to-keep-learning-without), so no one gets too far ahead or too behind. 

### For middle and high school classrooms
- **App Lab**, our online programming environment, is a powerful tool for middle and high school students to create and share *real working apps*. If you teach middle or high school and are new to App Lab, [start learning](https://code.org/applab)—and tell other teachers, too! If you’re already using App Lab, check out all our [feature updates](http://teacherblog.code.org/tagged/applab). 

- **The best interactive tools** from our CS Principles course are now available as [stand-alone tools](https://code.org/widgets) to teach computer science concepts such as encryption or compression in any middle or high school classroom.

<h3>Last but not least: the Hour of Code 2016 is coming! Sign up your classroom.</h3>
Join the biggest learning event in history this **CS Education Week, December 5-11**. Last year, 200,000 educators hosted an Hour of Code event—and together we reached every single country on the globe. [Sign up early](https://hourofcode.com/us#join) to help us reach *every student* this year.

On a personal note, thank you for all you do to give our children the opportunity to build their future. The computer science education movement is one of the best stories in the world today. It's unfolding right before our eyes, and it's thanks to you, the heroes of the movement.

Your support and the work you do every day in classrooms inspires all of us.
