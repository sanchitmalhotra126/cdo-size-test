Megan first tried computer science when her 6th grade class did the Hour of Code. She never even thought about coding before, but now she’s taking classes at a local university and reimagining her whole future! 

**With your generous support of Code.org**, we’ve introduced 48 million students to an Hour of Code to date!

**Please, renew your support for our children’s future by making a donation to our crowdfunding campaign.**

We need your help to [raise enough funds](http://igg.me/at/hourofcode/x/9228585) to introduce 100 million students to one Hour of Code, and to prepare 10,000 teachers to offer full computer science classes.

[**Donate now**](http://igg.me/at/hourofcode/x/9228585)

### Push us over our goal - it’s time for a sea change in education
Major supporters like Mark Zuckerberg, Sean Parker and Rich Barton (and 2000 others) have generously donated to our campaign, helping it become the biggest in Indiegogo history! 

There’s so much more work to do.

### Every dollar matched: unlock matching funds and double your impact
Generous donors have offered to <u>**match every dollar you donate**</u>. Your donation will help unlock this investment in our children’s future. Plus, we have some fun perks to thank you in return!

[Please add your year-end, tax-deductable donatation now](http://igg.me/at/hourofcode/x/9228585) so every student can have the opportunity Megan did.
