    Tomorrow the New Jersey Assembly is set to vote on an important bill that will give more students the chance to learn computer science in your schools. Assembly Bill 3440 (Senate Bill 2032) would require the State Board of Education to develop standards for middle and high school computer science curriculum, paving the way for more kids to access these critical skills.

      </p>
<p>
   <strong>Why is this a big deal?</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>There are 23,000 open computing jobs across all industries in New Jersey</li>
        <li>
        	These jobs are growing at over 4x the state average
        </li>
        <li>
        	But most schools don't even offer computer science
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
 <p>
        Most importantly, *every* student should have the opportunity to learn how technology works in todayâ€™s world. This is a problem we can solve.
