Dear UK Hour of Code organizer,

Great news! We are now able to send Hour of Code posters to organizers in the United Kingdom, to help get students excited and make your Hour of Code the best it can be.

**[Request a poster](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/forms/d/117rf_1OZBVS2tbKMkVMqVQyQv_SHA2hsoMkDwwU3L-c/viewform)**

The first 1,500 UK organizers to complete the request form will receive one Hour of Code poster, a participation guide, and stickers for students in the mail. 

There are 6 weeks before the Hour of Code.
