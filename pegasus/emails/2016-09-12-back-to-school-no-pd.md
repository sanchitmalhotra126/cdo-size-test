Thank you for being part of our movement to give every student the opportunity to learn computer science by attending a professional development workshop. If you enjoyed your experience at your workshop, tell another teacher about how to [find a workshop nearby](https://code.org/professional-development-workshops) and encourage them to attend. 

It’s thanks to you that this movement has broken records. Help us reach even farther this academic year. 

###New Code Studio features for your classroom, thanks to your feedback.

Our team wants to make sure our tools work best for your classroom. Here are some of the updates we’ve made based on your feedback. (We hope you keep the feedback coming.) 

#####New tools and features for *any* classroom</br>
- Have you encouraged pair programming in your classroom? We improved the way Code Studio tracks your students’ progress, even if 2 students are working on the same computer! Check it out and let us know how it’s working in your classroom. 
- Students can keep unused code in their workspace, allowing for more experimentation! 
- Keep your class on track with “Stage Extras”, so no one gets too far ahead or too behind. 

#####New tools for middle and high school classrooms</br>
- Our online programming environment, App Lab, is a powerful tool for middle and high school students (and up) to create and share real working apps. If you’re already using App Lab, check out all our feature updates. If you teach middle or high school and are new to App Lab, start learning or share this game changing tool with a middle or high school teacher.
- The best interactive tools from our Computer Science Principles course are now available as stand-alone tools to teach computer science concepts such as encryption or compression in any middle or high school classroom. 

###Join me in a back-to-school webinar.</br>
On September 22nd 7pmET/4pmPT, I’ll be hosting a back-to-school webinar open to all teachers, along with Alice Steinglass, VP of product and engineering, who will demo the features above. I hope to see you there. 

###The Hour of Code 2016 is coming! Sign up your classroom today. 
Join the biggest learning event in history during **CS Education Week, December 5-11**. Last year, 200,000 educators hosted an Hour of Code event, in every single country on the globe. Together, we can inspire every student to pursue bright futures with technology and give every student access to the foundations of computer science. 

Sign up early to receive a free inspiration kit with posters for your class showing role models in tech, and more!

Thank you for what you’re doing to give all of our children the opportunity to build their future.
