Yesterday, you may have received an email about our CS Discoveries facilitator program referencing the wrong state where you’re using CS Discoveries and where we are recruiting facilitators. We apologize for any confusion this error caused! 

We’re writing again to let you know that we’re recruiting facilitators in or near [our partner regions](https://code.org/educate/regional-partner/partners). Check this map to see if you live in a partner region, and if so, we encourage you to apply! (Many of these are statewide partnerships, even if just a city is pinned.)

**[Learn more and apply](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/facilitator) by February 1st.**

We apologize again for any confusion. We hope you consider applying, and I look forward to reading your application!
