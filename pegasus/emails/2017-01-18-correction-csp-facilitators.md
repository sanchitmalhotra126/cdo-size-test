<%= name_s %>,

Earlier today, you may have received an email about our new middle school curriculum, Computer Science Discoveries. We want to apologize for emailing you with information about the wrong course and possibly the wrong location. 

**We intended to tell you about an exciting opportunity to [apply to become a *Computer Science Principles* facilitator](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/cs-principles-facilitator)** because you were one of the first educators to use the Code.org CS Principles curriculum. 

We’re recruiting facilitators in or near [our partner regions](https://code.org/educate/regional-partner/partners). Check this map to see if you live in a partner region. (Many of these are statewide partnerships, even if just a city is pinned.)

**[Learn more and apply](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/facilitator) by February 1st.**

We apologize again for any confusion. We hope you consider applying, and I look forward to reading your application! If you have any questions about the Facilitator Development Program, visit [code.org/facilitator](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/facilitator) or email facilitators@code.org.
