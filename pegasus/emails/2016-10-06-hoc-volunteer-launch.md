Hi <%= name_s %>,

We’re following up because we received some questions about volunteering during the [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com), our annual campaign to introduce computer science to every student during Computer Science Education Week, December 5th-11th.

<h3>Join us for a volunteer webinar.</h3>
We’re hosting a [Volunteer Training Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZWz5XX5PXk) on Wednesday, October 12 @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET. Please join us for more information on how you can inspire students through an Hour of Code, and to ask any questions you have during a Q&A session.

<h3>Check out these awesome testimonials from volunteers in last year’s Hour of Code:</h3>

<em>“The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. It bodes well for the future of our industry to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”</em>

<em>“I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. Students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling at thinking like a developer. [Hour of Code] gave them a place to feel confident.”</em>

<h3>Here’s what you should expect:</h3>
1. Teachers can now search for volunteers in their area and learn a little more about them; they’ll be able to find you and the information you shared with us on [this worldwide map](https://code.org/volunteer/local).
2. If a teacher would like your help with their Hour of Code, they will contact you through an online form. You will receive an email from me (Tanya at Code.org) sharing the teacher’s message and full contact information.
3. Want more information? Join our [Volunteer Training Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZWz5XX5PXk) on Wednesday, October 12 @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET.
4. Review [this toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PcrOW44tq_leRIAUWeUDy-gdrLJGIUNBB_feXF8b9w0/edit#heading=h.x1s6hunmhamh) about how to coordinate with the teacher(s), things to do and share with the classroom, and what to expect when you volunteer.

<h3>What if you aren't contacted?</h3>
If you’re in a large city or technical hub, you may not be contacted due to the high number of volunteer signups in your area. If this is the case, instead of waiting to be contacted, I recommend reaching out directly to a school in your area and offering to help them organize an event, or to other organizations such as the [Girl Scouts](http://www.girlscouts.org/en/adults/volunteer.html) and [Boy Scouts](https://beascout.scouting.org/Volunteer.aspx) or [Boys & Girls Club of America](http://greatfutures.org/pages/).

You can also [host your own Hour of Code event](http://hourofcode.com)!

Students are so fortunate to have so many willing volunteers like you to inspire them during their Hour of Code. Thank you for supporting this movement!
