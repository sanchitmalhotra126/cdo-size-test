## We ask all <%= @company['display_name_s'] %> employees to try an Hour of Code in support of computer science education

Computer science is the defining field of the 21st century, yet most of us never learn it, and most schools don't even offer it. In support of our children's education and our future, we are asking every <%= @company['display_name_s'] %> employee to try an Hour of Code. Even if you already know computer science, you can try the modern tutorials, and help others learn.

Give it a shot. This is a tutorial that even 8-year-olds can do, and it's fun. Let's see how close we can get to 100% participation!
