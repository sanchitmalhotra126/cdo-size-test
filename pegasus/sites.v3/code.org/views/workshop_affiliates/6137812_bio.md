Greetings! I’ve been an educator in Pinellas County for over 20 years. I earned a Bachelor’s Degree from the University of Central Florida, a Master’s Degree from the University of South Florida in Curriculum and Instructions with an Emphasis on Education Technology. I’m a K-8 Technology/ Design teacher at St. Cecelia Catholic school in Clearwater. I’m a mom of two AMAZING boys. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with code.org since 2015. Within that time, I’ve trained over 1,160 teachers to use the K-5 curriculum. Please join me for a day of hands-on exploration of Computer Science. We’ll learn all about how to make CS accessible to all students! If you have any questions, please email me at green@pd.code.org. Hope to see you soon!
