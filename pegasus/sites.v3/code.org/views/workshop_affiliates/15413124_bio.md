## Sally Schmitt[tanguay32@gmail.com](mailto: tanguay32@gmail.com)Sally teaches Computer Science at Hunters Creek Middle School in Jacksonville, NC, home to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. She started her working career in the US Coast Guard as an Electronics Technologist before completing a BA in Computer Science (2000), becoming certified to teach Math and Science (2005), and completing a Masters in Instructional Technology (2019). She is one of only two teachers in Onslow County teaching Computer Science at the middle school level and hopes to see Computer Science expanded to all the middle schools in the county within the next few years. Her goal as a Code.org Facilitator and a member of CSTA is to help in expanding Computer Science education to as many students as possible in North Carolina. She and her husband, an EMT/Firefighter on MCB Camp Lejeune, have 8 children and 4 dogs in their blended family and spend much of their time with their family. In her spare time, Sally enjoys reading, painting, learning different coding languages and experimenting with technological gadgets that can be used to supplement her classroom lessons.
