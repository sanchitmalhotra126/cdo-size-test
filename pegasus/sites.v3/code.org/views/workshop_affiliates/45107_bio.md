Jeremy Harder was born in a quiet little town along the Delaware River in western New Jersey. Surrounded by farm lands, deciduous forests, meandering creeks and bass-filled ponds Jeremy found an appreciation for the outdoors at an early age. As he explored these areas with his grandfather after school and during summer break, Jeremy began to develop a keen sense of observing the oddities of the natural world.

Jeremy moved to Big Sky in 2000 to accept a fourth grade teaching position and fell in love with the community, outdoor adventures and his classroom.  During the summers he took advantage of the time off to hike the Continental Divide trail from Glacier to Yellowstone, backpack parts of the Appalachian Trail, tour Ireland on a pedal bike and explore the coastal ecosystems of southern Mexico.  When not coding, he chases after his 8 year old, Elijah and tries to fold laundry for his wife Kristin.
