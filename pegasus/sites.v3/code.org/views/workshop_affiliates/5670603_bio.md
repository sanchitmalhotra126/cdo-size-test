[danial.rowe@gmail.com](mailto: danial.rowe@gmail.com)Danial attended his first Code.org workshop in 2015 and fell in love with their hands on approach to training and the way they treat teachers: like professionals. He went on to pilot the CS Discoveries course and was part of the first cohort of CS Principles teachers. He has written Computer Science curriculum and taught for Dukeâ€™s Talent Identification Program (TiP) and also works with local art museums to integrate math into their educational programs.  He is a Raspberry Pi Certified educator and loves to tinker and build both in the classroom and at home with his son. Danial has been teaching since 2005, holds an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics and earned his Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) diploma from Duke in 2011. He is excited about both CS and helping teachers build their confidence in the CS classroom and his enthusiasm is evident in every workshop he facilitates.
