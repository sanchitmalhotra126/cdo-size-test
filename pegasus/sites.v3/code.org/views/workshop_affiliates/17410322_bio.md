Hailing from Nortwest Montana, Steve has been teaching for over 20 years in all kinds of settings. Although he is trained as a social studies teacher, he has a distinct passion for teaching computer science because, well, because it's fun! He has been using Code.org's curriculum since the initial Hour of Code in 2013
and he's been facilitating Code.org's professional development programs since 2017. Steve teaches, coaches and generally inspires students in app development, engineering, and robotics - that is when he's not skiing, hiking, golfing, fishing or rafting.
