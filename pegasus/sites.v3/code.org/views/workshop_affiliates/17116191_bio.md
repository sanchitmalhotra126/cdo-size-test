Amy has worked as an elementary educator for more than 25 years. After spending many years in the classroom, her role has shifted to support fellow educators and learners in her home district. Amy was introduced to code.org the first year Hour of Code was promoted. She was immediately a fan! She has since been using code.org curriculum with learners and supporting educators as they bring computer science to children.
