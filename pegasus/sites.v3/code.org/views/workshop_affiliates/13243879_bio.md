## David Ruf
[druf@ssummit.org](mailto: druf@ssummit.org)Since becoming a CS Discoveries Facilitator in 2017, David has had the opportunity to travel from coast to coast facilitating eleven different five-day workshops in eight separate states. In addition, as an original CS Discoveries Virtual Facilitator, he’s been able to pioneer the virtual workshop format providing CS training to teachers from Alaska to Texas. His favorite things about being a CS Discoveries Facilitator are the invaluable professional relationships, both with the incredibly dedicated and effective Code.org staff, as well as the hundreds of fellow teacher’s with whom he’s been able to collaborate. When he isn’t facilitating workshops, David can be found teaching middle school in Kamas, Utah. As a technology teacher in a rural area, his course offerings range from Coding to Woodshop.
