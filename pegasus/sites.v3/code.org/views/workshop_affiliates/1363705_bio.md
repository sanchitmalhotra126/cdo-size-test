**What teachers are saying...**

"This was absolutely one of the best professional development workshops 
that I have attended in 22+ years. The facilitator was very well prepared, 
and had a positive attitude toward the subject matter. She was friendly, 
patient, and helpful in every way. I am excited about this program." 

"Vanessa was extremely knowledgeable and related well to her audience. She 
settled my insecurity of teaching code to my students on my campus. Thank 
you for providing this opportunity to me."
