Gary is a retired director of educational technology for Public Media Connect, public television in Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio. His interest and background in computer science grew out of 15 years of volunteering for a drop-in after school program in a public housing development in Middletown, Ohio, where he used Scratch and other tools to help students develop interest in computers and a level of understanding about how they work.
