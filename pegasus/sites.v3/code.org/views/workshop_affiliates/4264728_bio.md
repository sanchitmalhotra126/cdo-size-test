I am currently in my 24th year of teaching. I have taught 2nd and 3rd grades, as well as, technology in a lab. I have been co-teaching technology with classroom teachers in my building for the past 12 years. I love teaching students and adults and have had the opportunity to lead professional development in my building, district and outside of my district. I'm thrilled to share my passion and excitement for computer science with you!
