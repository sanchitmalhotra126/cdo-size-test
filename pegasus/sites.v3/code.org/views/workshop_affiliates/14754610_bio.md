I am a retired teacher, coach, and professional development provider. After 18 years with Technology and Innovation in Education, I retired from full time and now am doing focused work for them including a CS Fundamentals Facilitator. I am also a CPM math coach traveling throughout the U.S. helping teachers implement their CPM curriculum. This work fits so well with my Masters in Computer Science and K-12 Math Specialist Certification. Working with teachers helping them reach their goals is such a joy!
