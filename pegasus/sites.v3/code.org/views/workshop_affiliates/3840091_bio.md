I also work with our elementary to present CS Fundamentals to their students. I believe that it is important to equip our students with 21st Century skills and knowledge. Teaching our students to be producers of technology and provide them with the thinking “outside the box” skills is vital. I have a passion for learning from others and for bringing new ideas to teachers. I truly enjoy and value Code.org’s commitment to equity and pray that all educators would commit to bringing equity to their classrooms. All educators should embrace a Lead Learner Philosophy and allow students to take responsibility, not only for their own learning but teaching others. I am excited to bring this curriculum to classrooms and to make these skills foundational for EVERY student. Through opportunities may we help; develop confidence in creation and expression and instill passion for discovery and inquiry across classroom borders.
