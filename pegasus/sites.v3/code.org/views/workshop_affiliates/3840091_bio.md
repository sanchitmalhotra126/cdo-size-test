I have been teaching for 9 years.  I entered teaching with a Master's in Agricultural Economics and Business. I teach multiple subjects but Computer Science is by far my favorite.  I have taught Computer Science for 5 years. I am also a momma to 4 boys. We live on a ranch and enjoy being outside with the livestock.
