Angelina earned a Master’s degree in Technology in Education in 2008, and thereafter she used her skills and natural creativity to give her social studies classes a more technologically interactive and fun experience for her learners. Although originally a Social Studies teacher, Angelina has been involved with Computer Science and Code.org for the past six years - first with the Hour of Code (in 2014), then as an Exploring Computer Science/CS Discoveries teacher (since 2015), and then as an AP CS Principles teacher (since 2016) and  an AP CS Principles Facilitator for Code.org (since 2017). Angelina always looks forward to helping a new set of teachers navigate the in's and out's of teaching CS, and in turn helping to shape the upcoming generation of students as they prepare for a life in a technology driven world.
