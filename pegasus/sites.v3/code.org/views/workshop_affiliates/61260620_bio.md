## Daniel Davis[davis.daniel@mybradford.us](mailto: davis.daniel@mybradford.us)My name is Daniel Davis and I am currently an Instructional Technology Specialist with the Bradford County School District in Starke, FL. I have a Masters Degree in Educational Leadership and I am certified in Physical Education, Driver Education and School Administration. I have worked as an Instructional Technology Specialist for 3 years. My primary responsibility is to identify and train teachers on classroom technology. I also have the opportunity to be the bridge between the IT Department and the school-based administrators, teachers, and staff. I am a strong believer that technology can support and enhance our classrooms and our ability to reach all students.
