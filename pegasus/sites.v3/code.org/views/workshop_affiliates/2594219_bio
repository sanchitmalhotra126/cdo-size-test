My name is Lisa Herring and I'm from Jacksonville, FL.  Presently, I am a Media Specialist/STEM teacher at a K-12 school but also teach Computer Science Discoveries to middle school students.  I have an Elementary of Education degree from Bowling Green State University in Ohio, certification in gifted education, and am a Computer Science Discoveries facilitator at UNF.  In my free-time, my husband and I enjoy spending time at our beach condo, hiking, riding bikes, and kayaking.
