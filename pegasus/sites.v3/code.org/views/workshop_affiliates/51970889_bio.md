I am the Science and Technology Coordinator for the Suwannee County School District.  This is my 31st year in education and I have served in a variety or roles including teacher, principal, teacher support colleague and my current role.  Technology has changed our world and we need to help our students be part of that change.  I have been married for 31 years to my wife, Jennifer, we have 2 children and most importantly 1 grandchild!
