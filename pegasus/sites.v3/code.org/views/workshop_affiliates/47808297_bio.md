## Teresa Hintze[Hintze_Teresa@asdk12.org](mailto: Hintze_Teresa@asdk12.org)For fifteen years, I worked in Deaf Education as a teacher, eventually teaching every subject and grade level K-12. For the past five years I have been working at a homeschool charter school helping and guiding parents in the education of their children. I have always had a passion for technology and throughout my teaching tenure have been lucky to have access to a wide variety of technological platforms. I found Code.org while searching for CS curriculums that my homeschool families could use and absolutely fell in love with it. While coding is extremely new to me (I am the epitome of the "lead learner") I am so excited every day to be working and learning with the CS Discoveries program.
