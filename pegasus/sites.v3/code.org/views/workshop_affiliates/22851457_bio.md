Hello! My name is Katie Brase. I am currently the Gifted and Talented Specialist at James Gibson and Myrtle Tate Elementary Schools within CCSD. I have a background in business, having graduated with a degree in marketing from Colorado State University (Go Rams!). I decided to switch career paths and entered teaching, where I discovered I have a passion for STEAM. Through my adventures in teaching, and learning about various STEAM initiatives, I discovered Code.org. Participating in the Code.org training whetted my appetite for coding, and I have taught it to my students ever since! During my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling, history, and spending time with my family and friends.
