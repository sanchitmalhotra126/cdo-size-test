Marsha Cruce is a Program Evaluator and STEM liaison in the Federal Programs Department of Putnam County School District in Florida. She has served as a Technology Specialist, Webmaster, Grant Writer, Project Manager and teacher. She has led Professional Development for teachers in technology integration and inquiry-based learning. She has a MA in Education from the University of North Florida. Her husband said he could write her bio with three words. Beautiful, smart and stubborn :) Thatâ€™s probably why they have stayed married for 44 years. He is definitely biased (see photographic evidence) but he got the stubborn part right! "
