I currently manage the district's Title IV grant where we have a focus on Advanced Academics and STEM. I have been in education for 29 years, working with elementary aged children ranging from ESE, to drop out prevention, regular education and finishing off my time in the classroom with gifted students. I have been working at the district level for the past ten years. I am also an adjunct professor teaching Elementary Math Methods at Flagler College.
