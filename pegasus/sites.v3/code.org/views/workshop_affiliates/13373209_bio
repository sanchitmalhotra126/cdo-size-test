I have been working in Baker County for 11 years. I am currently teaching in the STEAM Lab at Macclenny Elementary. I teach First through Third-grade science as well as technology. I have several programs I teach at our school. I use Osmo, littleBits, Artie, Squishy Circuits, Snap Circuits, Audrino OSOYOO,Code.org, WeDo 2.0, EV3. I currently have three FLL Teams and one GIRLS WHO CODE clubs. I try to introduce and explore different facets of technology with our students. The program I find most easily understood in these grades is Scratch and  Boxly. These programs click and drag. I love using Tynker as a launch site for other programs and exploring for coding. I am looking forward to working in Code.org and expanding my knowledge in this program. There is always room for growth and development.
