## Alison  Mohr[alison@newbo.co](mailto: alison@newbo.co)Hello! I am Alison Mohr and excited to be working with you as a CS Discoveries facilitator. I taught a middle school Computer Science and STEM course in Carlisle, Iowa for five years. I recently switched roles and joined the NewBoCo K-12 Education Team to help support districts, teachers, and families with computer science education. I live in Altoona with my husband and two children. I love cooking, running, and playing with my kids.
