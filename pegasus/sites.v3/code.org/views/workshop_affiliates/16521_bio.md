I am a K-4 Library/Technology teacher in beautiful Cape Cod where I was born and raised and currently live. While I started out my career as a library teacher, I have a passion for technology and love my roll in getting both the staff and students excited to incorporate technology into their learning and teaching. I am also a Google Certified Educator as well as a Common Sense, BrainPop and Sphero Educator.
