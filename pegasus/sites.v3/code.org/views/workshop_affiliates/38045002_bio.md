She is currently employed at Chiefland Middle/High School in Levy County, Florida.  She has 24 years of teaching experience, including 22 years teaching varied levels of math, and 2 years teaching computer science and business classes.  Living in a small rural town in North Central Florida has its challenges, but it also has great rewards.  She wouldn't want to live or work anywhere else.  She loves life.  Things that are important to her are:  family, faith, patriotism, loyalty, and preparing students to be the best they can be.
