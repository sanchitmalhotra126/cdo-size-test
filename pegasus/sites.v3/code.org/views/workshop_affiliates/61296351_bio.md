Wanda Wilkinson is a former elementary, middle, and high school classroom teacher who is currently working at the Putnam County School District Office of Federal Programs. Wanda works as the Parent and Family Engagement Coordinator and assists with grant compliance. Wanda has a Masters Degree in Educational Leadership and an endorsement in Reading. She is interested in supporting the district's STEM initiative and wants to contribute by increasing her knowledge of STEM and sharing what she learns. Gordon B. Hinckley said, “There are few things more pathetic than those who have lost their curiosity and sense of adventure, and who no longer care to learn.” Wanda believes STEM engenders curiosity and is excited to begin the adventure of new learning.
