I have been an elementary technology teacher in the Fair Lawn Public School district for 6 years, and I currently serve on our Future Ready Schools committee.      I am also a proud mother of three grown children.  I love teaching K-5 students and introducing them to the world of computer programming!  I am passionate about teaching young learners how to thrive in today's digital world.
