I am definitely a Jack-of-All Trades and in addition to being a Code.org Fundamentals Facilitator; I am an Ed Tech Collaborator, former School Librarian, and Classroom Teacher.  I have taught mostly upper Elementary, M.S. Math, H.S. Biology/Psychology and student teaching seminars.

I have lived in Alaska for the last 24 years, and am originally from Nebraska.  My husband Gary and I  have two adult children;  Raimey and Dawson, who still live with us and attend College. Gary is a Biologist with USGS and there have been times when I have been his field hand and the kids have been able to come on some adventures in Resurrection Bay or out of Homer, Alaska.   We love to ski, hike, fish, and enjoy all that Alaska has to offer!
