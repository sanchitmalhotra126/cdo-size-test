I am currently working as the Coordinator of Library Media and Instructional Technology in the Baltimore City Public School System in Baltimore, Maryland.  I am a former classroom teacher, Instructional Technology Curriculum Specialist and IT Teacher Support Manager.  As coordinator, I work with librarians and technology lab teachers to promote coding in our schools and to push the idea of computational thinking as a foundational skill that can be integrated into all content areas.
