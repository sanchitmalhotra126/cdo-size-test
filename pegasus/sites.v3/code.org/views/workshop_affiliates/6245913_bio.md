## Floresa Vaughn[floresa.vaughn@gmail.com](mailto: floresa.vaughn@gmail.com)Originally a math teacher, I am now a Computer Scientist. I love teaching, facilitating and learning. I look forward to working with workshop participants, bringing out the knowledge they already possess, and sharing that with the rest of the room. I believe we can learn and build together. CS4ALL!
