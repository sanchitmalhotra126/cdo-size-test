## Zachary  Marshall
[zmarshall@waverlyk12.net](mailto: zmarshall@waverlyk12.net)Zac teaches computer science and math at the high school level in Lansing, MI. He has used the AP CSP curriculum from the first year it was created.  He is an example of a lead learner and what Code.org can do to support teachers who don’t have a CS background. He has grown to love computer science even though he doesn’t have a degree in it and loves to share his experiences with new teachers who don’t have a computer science background. Many of his students go on to study computer science in college.  He has also had students go into the military and specialize in computer science right after they graduate from high school. He received his bachelor’s degree in secondary math and physical education from Spring Arbor University and his Master’s in Administration from Grand Canyon University. His family consists of his wife and 2 children and they love to travel around the country together in their travel trailer.
