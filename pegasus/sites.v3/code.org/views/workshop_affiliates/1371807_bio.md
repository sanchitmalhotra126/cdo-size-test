**What teachers say about Dominic's workshops**

"I truly enjoyed the workshop. I have teaching for 26 years, and this has been one of the better professional development workshops that I have attended.  I wouldn't change a thing. The workshop was well paced and met the needs of the attendees." - Toiya C. from Santa Monica, CA

"The presenter is very passionate about Code.org and the workshop was a success because of it. I had came across Code.org by accident, and now after attending the workshop I am even more excited about having my students go through the courses." - Starlett H. from Hesperia, CA
