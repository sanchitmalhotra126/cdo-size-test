Carrie Feyler is an Elementary Technology Teacher to 550 kids in Grades 1-5.  She is also Mama to two boys who are great test subjects for all of her classroom ideas. Carrie loves nothing more than hearing cries of, "I DID IT!" and "I FIGURED IT OUT!" in her classroom.  She believes that Computer Science is crucial for all students.  It is about trying, failing, problem solving, collaborating, making, creating, and succeeding.  It creates lifelong learners and prepares students for all types of jobs, no matter what their interests.  In her free time, Carrie enjoys reading, crocheting, scrapbooking, crafting, camping, and planning adventures with her family.
