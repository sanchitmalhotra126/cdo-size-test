I've taught every grade level (K-12) as a Library Media from K-12 and have taught Middle School, High School and Dual Credit Social Studies.  My current assignment is teaching technology to grades 1-4 and Computer Coding grades 7 and 8.   I started teaching in a small rural school in Eastern Montana where I was the Middle School and High School Social Studies Department as well as the Elementary and HS Library Media Specialist.  Teaching in the mornings at an elementary school that has over 600 students and at the Middle School across town in the afternoon is certainly a different experience. :-)
