 I am currently the Computer Science Coordinator for Allegheny Intermediate Unit in Western Pennsylvania. I am working with the PA Dept of Ed and the state's regional ESAs to support and grow CS education across the state. My previous experience is as a Curriculum Coordinator and Grade 4-8 math and science teacher.
