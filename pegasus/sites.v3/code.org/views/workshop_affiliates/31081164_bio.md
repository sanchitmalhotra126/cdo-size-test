I'm a School Library Media Specialist. I teach Library & Technology classes to 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders. I lead Makerspace in the morning. As LMS I also function as a technology integrationist and I provide technical support as part of the IT Team. I am a Google Administrator and Google Certified Educator (Level 2). I promote computer science and host Hour of Code.
