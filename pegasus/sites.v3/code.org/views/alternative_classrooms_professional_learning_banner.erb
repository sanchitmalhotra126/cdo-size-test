<%# This banner is specifically for the alternative-classrooms page. Ideally, we wouldn't have separate
view just for the professional_learning_apply_banner on that page, but because of how our partials work 
(see "Advanced Partials" section here https://code.org/editing/concepts), we have to create a separate
view in order to pass a parameter%>
