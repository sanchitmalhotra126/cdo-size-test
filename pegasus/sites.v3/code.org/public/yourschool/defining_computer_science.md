# How we define whether a school teaches computer science

Each school on our map fits into one of four possible categories:

- **Need information**. This means we don’t have information yet for this school. If your school is in this category, please [fill out the survey](https://code.org/yourschool#form) or [send the survey](https://code.org/yourschool/letter) to someone at the school who can fill it out.
- **Offers a computer science class** This means that we have data for this school that indicates that it offers  a computer science class. (More on this below)
- **Offers limited or no computer science** This means that we have data for this school indicating that the school does not offer any computer science classes. This school may offer other computer science education opportunities, like after school programs, clubs, or Hour of Code events. 
- **Inconsistent data** This means that we have  conflicting data points for this school that we have not resolved. If your school is in the category, it may help to get more data. Please [fill out the survey](https://code.org/yourschool#form) or [send the survey](https://code.org/yourschool/letter) to someone at the school who can fill out the survey. 

## Overview of the data sources we use
The data shown on the map on code.org/yourschool comes from one of four sources:

- Survey responses from teachers and administrators collected at [code.org/yourschool](https://code.org/yourschool)
- The College Board’s list of school that offer AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles.
- State Departments of Education, with which we are collaborating to identify high schools that offer computer sciences.  If you work with your State Department of Education and would like to submit data for your entire state, please reach out to miranda.lewis@code.org.
- The International Baccalaureate’s list of high schools offering IB computer science classes (standard level and higher level).

Once we have collected a sufficient amount of information on a school with inconsistent data, we compare responses based on the volume and source to gauge its computer science offering. 

## Definition for teaching a computer science class
Computer Science is the study of computers and algorithms, including their principles, design, implementation, and impact on society. Computer Science is about how to create new technologies, not simply use them.  While many schools offer their students  some exposure to computer science in a limited capacity such as an Hour of Code, this report focuses on schools that teach computer science in a class.  These are schools where there are students learning computer science in class (not in after school clubs) for a minimum number of hours and spending a minimum amount of time applying learned concepts through programming.  While computer science is broader than programming, some direct programming experience is integral to learning the fundamental concepts. 

You may see the category indicators change for schools on our map change as we continue to collect or correct data. If you believe that the information for your school is incorrect, please [fill out the survey](https://code.org/yourschool#form).
