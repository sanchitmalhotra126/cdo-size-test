Every student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. Computational thinking helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity. And technology is transforming every industry on the planet. Students today should learn how to create technology, not just use it. By starting early, they’ll have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path.

**Thank you for joining Vista Equity Partners and Code.org to help introduce millions of students to computer science through the Hour of Code!**

[<button>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</button>](/volunteer)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<button>Back to Vista Equity Partners Portal</button>](https://hourofcode.com/vista-equity-partners)

<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

Anyone passionate about computer science education and careers in tech can be a volunteer. We want volunteers of all ages, backgrounds and experience levels who have a passion for increasing diversity in tech. The Hour of Code has a large variety of tutorials for all ages and skill levels so you don’t need to be an expert to volunteer!

Volunteers are most needed during the Hour of Code, but if you're also interested in a year-round commitment teachers are constantly looking for professionals and students alike to inspire their students.

The more information you provide, the more likely a teacher will contact you. In order to sign up:

- Add your Vista Equity Partners company and use your **company email**. Your email address will never be shared.
- Select the checkbox to "I’m interested in volunteering year-round" if you want to volunteer throughout the year, outside of the Hour of Code. If you do not select this checkbox, you will only be displayed on the map during September-December.
- All Vista Equity Partners professionals are welcome to volunteer! We want students to learn about all career paths in tech. Please provide a short description at the bottom of the form about your connection to computer science and careers in tech.


<a name="why"></a>
### **Why volunteer?**
**Check out some testimony from past volunteers:**

- *“The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. It bodes well for the future of our industry to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”*
- *“Especially enjoyed getting to encourage young girls in technology. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.”*
- *“I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. One amazing thing was that the teachers noticed that some of the students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling at thinking like a developer and helping others are them - giving them a place to feel confident.”*

<a name="matching"></a>
### **The matching process:**

- Teachers will be searching for volunteers on our [volunteer map](https://code.org/volunteer/local)
- Teachers will be reviewing your profiles on the map, so try to make your profile as complete as possible to increase the chance that a teacher will select you.
- A teacher will contact you through this form (your email address will never be shared with the teacher).
- If you are receiving too many requests from teachers, you can always update your preferences by clicking the link to edit your information or unsubscribe, provided at the bottom of any email from a teacher.

## Volunteer in a classroom

<a name="prepare"></a>
### **How to prepare:**
Try out tutorials before heading to the classroom by going to https://code.org/learn<br>
Prepare an intro:
Get the students excited! Pick out a <a href="videos">video</a> to help focus the class and get them excited to do an Hour of Code.

* Watch 2016's volunteer training [webinar](https://plus.google.com/events/ct1vlm9btosksrvlt7kggdoo0mk) and [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-SRpceNbw3c-BtGYXKC3tTw3JSJ-5OZg6Ay4XFh7h50/edit?usp=sharing)
* If you're going to be doing a tutorial during your session, spend 30 minutes trying at least one [Hour of Code tutorial](/learn)
* If you're visiting a school, complete any background checks or required paperwork
* [Review these tips](https://code.org/files/CSTT_Volunteers.pdf) about how to interact with students
* Prepare an intro:
	* Share an inspirational story: How you got involved in a career in tech or why tech is important to you
	* Get the students excited! Pick out a video to show to help focus the class and get them excited to do an Hour of Code.
* Join the conversation on FB, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr with #Hourofcode
* Connect with the teacher to discuss what you plan to speak about during your session
* If you are a virtual volunteer, test A/V and screen sharing capabilities beforehand

<a name="practices"></a>
### **Day-of best practices:**
* Sign into the school and greet the teacher. Confirm the agreed schedule for the day and discuss any talking points.
* Spend 5 minutes talking about yourself, who inspired you to pursue a career in tech and/or computer science.
	* Introduce yourself: who you are and what you do
	* Choose one <a href="videos">inspirational video</a> and show it to the entire classroom together. Answer any questions from students.
	* Share a short story about how you got interested in computer science. What or who inspired you? What do you love most about your job? Keep it short! ;) The point is to let the kids do the coding, leave time for more questions at the end.
	* Share how computer science has broad, worldwide impact.
* Let the students dive into the tutorials. Walk around the classroom answering any questions and guiding them through tough puzzles. Try not to give students the solution outright, instead try asking them questions so they can answer themselves what went wrong.
* Encourage students to ask each other if they have questions. Learning from each other is a great learning opportunity. Often kids can solve the problems themselves and through teamwork. 
* At the completion of the activities, hand out your Vista Equity Partners swag (stickers are awesome) and answer any remaining questions!
* Also important to mention that if you do take pictures/videos during the event -- especially with students -- that you get **teacher/parent permission** if you would like to post your stories on social media.

<a name="faq"></a>
## FAQ:

**I haven’t heard from any teachers yet. Is there anything else I can do while I wait?**<br>
You don’t have to wait for a teacher to contact you to get started! Search in your area for local schools and school districts. You can email the principal, computer science teachers, or technology teachers and ask them if they’re doing the Hour of Code and are looking for volunteers. Or, reach out to local organizations like Boys and Girls Club, Boys or Girls Scouts, etc.


**A teacher is interested in teaching computer science beyond the Hour of Code. Where should I direct them?**<br>
If the teacher you’re working with wants to offer computer science classes ongoing, point them to code.org/teach for resources to get started.


**The school I’m working with has little or no Internet. What Hour of Code activities are available to them?**<br>
There are lots of options for unplugged activities. Visit code.org/learn and look for the “unplugged” carousel to see a list of options from our partners. This list will be updated in early November with this year’s submissions. Code Studio has also collected its own unplugged tutorials together here. We also have offline versions of [Star Wars](http://studio.code.org/download/starwars) and [Minecraft](http://studio.code.org/download/mc) that can be downloaded by the teacher and installed on each computer in advance of their Hour of Code event.


**I want to help with translations. How do I start?**<br>
Visit code.org/translate for more information or email translations@code.org for any questions.


**I want to host my own Hour of Code event with my kids or organization. Where do I sign up?**<br>
Register your own event through the [Vista Equity Partners portal](https://hourofcode.com/vista-equity-partners)!


**Are there any Hour of Code activities for students with disabilities?**<br>
We’re working to improve our selection but for now we only have a recommendation for Quorum. This [lesson plan](https://drive.google.com/a/code.org/file/d/0B4hvv01Osu00OTdyX0J3RkZJZ1E/view?usp=drivesdk) is for an activity designed for visually challenged students.


**How do I see or edit my information?**<br>
When you signed up you should have received a confirmation email with a link to view/edit your information. If you’re unable to locate that email or edit your information, please email volunteers@code.org for support.
