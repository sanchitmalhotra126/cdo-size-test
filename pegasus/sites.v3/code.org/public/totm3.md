# Nominate a Teacher of the Month

## We want to recognize teachers who are changing the face of computer science.

Do you know a Code.org **Teacher of the Month**?

- A teacher who is engaging or inspiring students in an exceptional way?
- One who's working hard to spread computer science beyond their classroom?

### Please share tell us about a rockstar teacher you know
Your nomination doesn't need to be full-time computer science teacher, either. The world deserves to hear about the amazing work they're doing! Please no self nominations.
