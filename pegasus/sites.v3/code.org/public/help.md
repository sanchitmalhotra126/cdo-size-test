# How to Help
## Host an Hour of Code- at work, in your community, or local school
More than 44 million people of all ages have learned an [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com), a one-hour introductory course designed to demystify computer science and show that anybody can learn the basics.  Participate this December 8-14 during Computer Science Education Week and help reach 100 million students by the end of 2014.

## Make a generous donation - before December 14!
[Donate to our crowdfunding campaign](/donate). To teach 100 million children, we need your support. We just launched what could be the [largest education crowdfunding campaign](/donate) in history. Every dollar will be matched by major Code.org [donors](/about/donors), doubling your impact.

## Ask your school to teach computer science
Encourage local elementary schools to teach our [K-5 curriculum](/k5) or recruit teachers to attend a [one-day workshop](/professional-development-workshops)- at no cost. Or [partner with Code.org](/educate/districts) to bring permanent courses into middle and high schools.

### Or become a volunteer teacher yourself with one of these organizations:

- [CoderDojo](http://www.coderdojo.com) - Start a Dojo in your neighborhood, mentor children to learn to code.
- [TEALS](http://www.tealsk12.org) - Volunteer to teach Intro and AP CS classes 2 days a week in local high schools.
- [Citizen Schools](http://www.citizenschools.org/curriculum-category/science-technology/) - Volunteer to teach computer programming in extended-day programs at schools.


## Teach an online course to your child, or in any classroom
Code.org's online platform [Code Studio](studio.code.org) enables students to learn the basic concepts of computer science as early as kindergarten. Within Code Studio, a new Play Lab has been developed where elementary students can create and send apps or animations directly to a cell phone, just by typing in the phone number.
