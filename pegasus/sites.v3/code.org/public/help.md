# How to Help

## Advocate for computer science locally
Petition your state to allow computer science to count towards math or science high school graduation credits. And promote computer science in your area with these [stats, quotes and videos](/promote).

[<button>Add your support</button>](/promote)

## Ask your school to teach computer science
If your local school doesn't offer computer science, ask them to teach our [upcoming elementary curriculum](/educate/k5) or [partner with Code.org](/educate/districts) to bring permanent courses into middle and high schools.
 
[<button>See Options</button>](/educate)

## Host an Hour of Code - at work or in your community
More than 30 million people of all ages have learned an Hour of Code, a one-hour intro to computer science. Then, encourage your students to [learn beyond one hour](/learn/beyond), or to sign up for a [local camp or workshop](/learn/local).

## Make a generous donation
Code.org is a public 501c3, with support from the general public. Founded initially by Ali Partovi and Hadi Partovi, we've been overwhelmed by small and large acts of generosity from [individuals and companies](/about/donors) who support our vision.
