# Employees volunteer in a classroom

The volunteer in a classroom program gives your employees the opportunity to be a guest speaker or volunteer. They can join local classrooms or participate remotely via video call. Most employees will volunteer once or twice a year with this program. This opportunity is provided year-round, however, the demand for volunteers in our teachers' classrooms is much higher in December during Computer Science Education Week.

Hello [NAME],

Computer science is the defining field of the 21st century, yet most schools don’t teach it. Join us to help give every student in every school the opportunity to learn!

I am excited to announce that [COMPANY] will be joining Code.org this year to help bring CS education opportunities to all students!

Last year, we had over [X] employees volunteer and we hope to exceed our goal this year! 

Just 1-2 hours per year of your time is enough to be a guest speaker in a classroom or help a teacher run an Hour of Code event. Teachers are looking for volunteers to come join them in the classroom and/or speak remotely through video conferencing.

How you can get involved:
<strong>Volunteer in a Classroom</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li>Sign up to volunteer [here](https://code.org/volunteer)</li>
<li>Learn [how to help](https://hourofcode.com/how-to/volunteers) out in the classroom</li>
<li>Teachers looking for volunteers in your area will see your listing and can reach out to you directly. (Demand is highest in Nov-Dec as new teachers prepare to host Hour of Code events.)</li>
<li>Have fun volunteering!</li>
</ul>

[COMPANY] is proud to participate in this worldwide effort. With your help we will introduce many students to computer science who might not have discovered it otherwise. Technology is transforming the globe—this is our opportunity to transform technology by promoting equity and diversity in the field’s education and career pathways.

<i>Important Information:</i><br/>
<ul>
<li>Watch the [Volunteer Training Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZWz5XX5PXk): What to expect when volunteering in a classroom</li>

</ul>

**Past volunteer testimony:**
<ul>
<li>“The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. **It bodes well for the future of our industry** to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”</li>
<li>“Especially enjoyed getting to **encourage young girls in tech**. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.”</li>
<li>“I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. One amazing thing was that the teachers noticed that some of the **students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling** at thinking like a developer and helping others - giving them a place to feel confident.”</li>
</ul>
