# Start a computer science club!

Do you enjoy learning new technology and want to volunteer to help bring computer science to students in your local area? Start an after school club teaching computer science or partner with your local Boys and Girls Club, school, community center or other organizations. 

1. Create your club (grades K-12) 
	* Contact local schools, after school clubs or other organizations. If you’re new to teaching, partner with an organization and an experienced teacher.
	* **Use these [letters/resources](#sample) to reach out to organizations in your area**
1. Sign up online
	* We provide all the [curriculum, lesson plans, and materials](#curriculum) at no cost
	* **Create an account and set up your classroom**
	* **[Fill out this form to let us know you’re creating a new computer science club](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScH17jl8j_6T0bR9OiMWFin-wz1HtLg3VyYkj5jeGf5_llESw/viewform?usp=sf_link)!**
1. Teach!
	* If you’re new to teaching, here are some teaching tips.
	* Tweet about your club to inspire others!

### Sample email to recruit after school organization
[letter]

Subject Line: Bring computer science to [ORGANIZATION]!

Dear [NAME],

Computer science is foundational knowledge for all students in the 21st century, but most schools don’t teach it--especially at the elementary level. In a Gallup poll, 9 out of 10 parents wanted their child to take computer science. Have you looked into offering a computer science after school club or integrating it into your existing program? 

If your team doesn’t have experience with computer science, we’d like to help you get started at no cost to you. In partnership with [COMPANY] and Code.org resources, we can launch a fun and innovative after school program focused on teaching computer science for K-12 students. [COMPANY] is dedicated to giving back to our local communities and believes computer science education is crucial in order to give every student the opportunity to succeed.

[COMPANY] will provide volunteers and a co-teacher to help run the after school program. This co-teacher can help with implementation, support, and guidance. [ORGANIZATION] only needs to provide a room, computers for the children, and a teacher/counselor to manage the classroom. The teacher needs no experience with computer science - we’ll help with that part.

I would love to set up a meeting to discuss this opportunity and partnership with you. Please let me know if there is a time in the next week to connect.

Thank you for considering bringing these life-changing skills to our children! I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,
<br>SIGNED

## Implementation Guidance
### How to set up your program
Code.org’s Computer Science Fundamentals curriculum can be accessed within Code.org’s online education platform. This completely free curriculum consists of multiple courses, each of which has about 20 lessons that may be implemented and adapted based on the length of your program

**Hardware**

Code.org works on all browsers and on any kind of computer or tablet: Cromebooks, windows, ipads, android, etc. You’ll need computers/tablets for at least 50% of the class, and headphones are nice but not required. 

Don’t worry if computers are in short supply, your students can work in pairs with [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q)! This is a great way for students to partner up and help each other through the exercises while relying on each other and less on the instructors. They will also see that computer science is social and collaborative. 

**Internet Access**

You’ll need internet access for at least 50% of the class. We suggest utilizing “[unplugged](/curriculum/unplugged)” activities throughout the course. These are hands on exercises that foster collaboration and don’t require a computer or internet access.

Don’t forget to check to make sure Code.org is not blocked! Check out our IT Requirements page for more information.

**Timing**

Recommendation: 45-60 minute class once per week for 20 weeks.  But, there are a lot of ways the coding club can be structured and it will vary from club to club depending on you and the partner organization’s capacity. The curriculum materials are flexible and can be taught in longer/shorter blocks - the curriculum and resources are here to help guide you, but we suggest that you go through the materials provided with your “co-teacher” and make them your own. 

If for some reason you can only hold one or two sessions for the students, we suggest going through one of the many Hour of Code [tutorials](/learn).


**Picking the right course for your students**

* Pre readers: [Course 1](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school#overview)
* Beginners in elementary school: [Course 2-3](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school#overview)
* Middle school or high school: [Accelerated courses](https://studio.code.org/s/20-hour)

We strongly encourage you to try the courses while structuring your coding club. This will help you get a sense of what your students will be doing and learning.
