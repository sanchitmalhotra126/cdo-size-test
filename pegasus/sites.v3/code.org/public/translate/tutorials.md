# Translating the site and tutorials
The majority of our translations are done through CrowdIn, a localization management platform. It is free to join and any volunteer can immediately contribute to the project by providing translations. 

There are currently three projects, the [Code.org Project](https://crowdin.com/project/codeorg), [Hour of Code Project](https://crowdin.com/project/hour-of-code), and [Curriculum Project](https://crowdin.com/project/lesson-plans). Please complete translations for these projects in that order of priority. If you have completed translations (at least 75% of the project is complete) and do not see your language in the drop down menu, please send a report to translations@code.org.


## How translations are selected

Members of the project are either a translator or proofreader. A translator can provide translations, while a proofreader can both provide translations as well as select the best translation to be used on the site.

The final translation that appears on our site is selected as follows:

1. A proofreader selects the best translation.
2. If there is no translation selected by a proofreader, translators vote on the best translation and the translation with the most votes is selected.
3. if votes are tied, the most recent translation will be selected.
