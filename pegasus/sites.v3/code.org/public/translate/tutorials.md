# Translating the site and tutorials
The majority of our translations are done through CrowdIn, a localization management platform. It is free to join and any volunteer can immediately contribute to the project by providing translations.

There are currently three projects, the [Code.org Project](https://crowdin.com/project/codeorg), [Hour of Code Project](https://crowdin.com/project/hour-of-code), and [Curriculum Project](https://crowdin.com/project/lesson-plans). Please complete translations for these projects in that order of priority. If you have completed translations (at least 75% of the project is complete) and do not see your language in the drop down menu, please send a report to translations@code.org.

## What do I translate first?
Right now, we're focused on translating the instructions of our courses. In the project, select dashboard/instructions.yml. Complete this file by course, by searching for the course keyword in the search bar.

* [Hour of Code levels 1-15](http://studio.code.org/hoc/1) - go to file dashboard/data.yml and search for "maze_2"
* [Hour of Code levels 16-20](http://studio.code.org/hoc/16) - search for "Scrat"
* [Frozen Code with Anna and Elsa](http://studio.code.org/s/frozen) - search for "Frozen"
* [Disney Infinity Play Lab](http://studio.code.org/s/infinity) - search for "Infinity"
* [Course 1](http://studio.code.org/s/course1) - search for "K-1"
* [Course 2](http://studio.code.org/s/course2) - search for "2-3"
* [Course 3](http://studio.code.org/s/course2) - search for "4-5"
* [Course 4](http://studio.code.org/s/course4) - search for "Course 4"

If you have more time, complete the pegasus, blockly-core, blockly-mooc, and dashboard folders in that prioritized order.

## How translations are selected

Members of the project are either a translator or proofreader. A translator can provide translations, while a proofreader can both provide translations as well as select the best translation to be used on the site.

The final translation that appears on our site is selected as follows:

1. A proofreader selects the best translation.
2. If there is no translation selected by a proofreader, translators vote on the best translation and the translation with the most votes is selected.
3. if votes are tied, the most recent translation will be selected.
