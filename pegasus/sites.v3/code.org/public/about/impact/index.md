# Results and Impact > Code.org Program Evaluation Report: September 2014 - June 2015

Code.org is is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. From the beginning Code.org has partnered with [Outlier Research & Evaluation at the University of Chicago](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), a third-party evaluator, to research and understand our impact and progress towards meeting our mission.

This school year, our evaluation work focused on answering the following key questions:

## What impact does Code.org professional development have on teachers?

During the 2014-15 school year, Code.org prepared over 11,000 teachers across K-12 attended Code.org workshops. We offered [professional development](/educate/professional-development) through two models:

- a day-long, face-to-face workshop delivered to K-5 teachers by trained facilitators, via our [Affiliate Program](/educate/k5-affiliates)
- a multi-phase, year-long blended PD experience delivered to Middle and High School teachers via our [District Partnership Program](/educate/districts)

**Key Finding: Through our professional development efforts, we are helping a large, diverse audience of K-12 educators feel more prepared to teach Computer Science using our resources.** <br /><br/>

*Table: Overall Participation and Satisfaction in Code.org Professional Development, Sept 1 2014 - June 15 2015*

|  | K-5 Teachers (via Affiliate Program)| Middle and High School Teachers (via District Partnership Program)|
|---|--------|-----|
| Number of teachers trained | 9,290 | ~1,600 |
| I would recommend the PD to others | 98% | 97% |
| This was the best PD ever | 66% | 81%|
| I feel prepared to teach CS | 94% | 88% |

## How successful have our district partnerships been in driving short- and long-term outcomes in each region?

In 2014-15, Code.org [partnered with over 70 districts](/educate/districts) across the United States to bring curriculum, professional development and support to over 1,600 new CS teachers.

**Key Finding: Through our district partnerships, we are helping districts increase the priority of computer science locally in the face of some big challenges.** <br /><br/>

## What learning outcomes have Code.org students achieved?

**Key Finding: Students across thousands of Code.org classrooms have demonstrated the ability to use computer science and computer programming concepts, starting as early as elementary school.** <br /><br/>

[Code Studio](http://studio.code.org), our online learning platform is designed to host our interactive CS courses. All online courses  are complemented by lesson plans teachers can deliver in the classroom. We saw phenomenal growth in the 2014-15 school year for both student and teacher account creation.

*Table: Code Studio User Growth, Sept 1 2014 - June 30 2015*

|  | Student Accounts Created| Teacher Accounts Created|
|---|--------|-----|
| Prior to September 1 2014 | 1,440,227 | 35,976 |
| September 1 2014 through June 30 2015 | 4,466,810 | 111,684 |
| All time (as of August 1 2015) | 6,033,943 | 147,660 |

The diversity of the audience we are reaching is also interesting to note. Across all student accounts that self-reported demographic data, **43% self-identified as female** and **37% self-identified as African-American or Hispanic**. 

By comparison, the [demographic breakdown](/files/APCS-2014.pdf) of students taking the most recent AP Computer Science exam in high school was **20% females** and **17% African American, Hispanic, or other historically underrepresented students**.

*Table: Participation in CS courses by demographic*

|  | Code Studio Student Account Holders| AP Computer Science Exam Candidates|
|---|--------|-----|
| % self-identifying as female | 43% | 37% |
| % self-identifying as African American or Hispanic | 20% | 17% |

In addition to studying who we're reaching, we also studied the concepts students are exploring through Code Studio.

*Table: Number of Students Demonstrating Skill in CS Concepts (defined as having solved 80% of the puzzles in at least one stage that teaches that concept)*
<br><br>

| Sept 14 2014 - June 15 2015 | Sequencing | Debugging | Loops | Conditionals | Nested Loops | Event handlers | Functions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Course 1 | 524,776 | 394,986 | 161,185 | -  | -  |  124,559 | -  |
| Course 2 | 516,595 | 140,135 | 219,110 | 90,550 | 65,785 | 273,849 | -  |
| Course 3 | 114,250 | 18,937 | 114,250 | 27,736 | 25,008 | 24,716 | 45,878 |
*Note: If the same student did course 1 and 2, they are double counted for a concept. On the other hand, this does not account for learning the concept more deeply by repeating it in different contexts, or at more depth.*

## Does learning Computer Science have impact on learning other subjects?

Although we are still early in terms of making a direct link between computer science course participation and learning gains in other subjects, a number of recent studies by our partners have shown interesting positive results connecting CS experience with performance in Math and other fields.<br /><br/>

## Next Steps: Implications for the 2015-16 School Year
Our 2015-16 evaluation plan, developed in concert with [Outlier](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), covers:

- Student outcomes on curricular (part of the course materials) and extra-curricular assessments (general CS concepts test) as well as pre/post attitudinal change. 
- Program improvement based on classroom implementation studies and teacher feedback.
- Teacher pre/post attitudinal and pedagogical outcomes.
- Effect of CS in Algebra and K-5 courses on Math/Science/Reading scores.
- Additionally, Outlier will work with our district partners to develop sustainability plans.

Internally, through participant surveys and data science projects, we will continue to study:

- Workshop satisfaction (including online PD components)
- Student outcomes measured through Code Studio

## Evaluation Design
We have gathered data from a number of sources -- internal data collected via Code Studio as well as external data collected by third parties -- in order to evaluate our impact and make decisions about future program direction. We are currently hiring for an [internal evaluation manager](/about/jobs#Eval) to work in collaboration with Outlier, in order to expand our ability to study student learning outcomes. All data cited in this summary are available [upon request](mailto:teach@code.org).
