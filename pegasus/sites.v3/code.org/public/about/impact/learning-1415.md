# [Results and Impact](/about/impact) > CS Learning Impact Research, 2014-15

## Does learning Computer Science have impact on learning other subjects?

### Summary
Although we are still early in terms of making a direct link between Computer Science course participation and learning gains in other subjects, a number of recent studies by our partners have shown interesting positive results connecting CS experience and Math performance. More rigorous study is needed. At a minimum, the lack of negative correlations shows that introducing CS does no harm.

### Detailed Findings

Our evaluation partner, [Outlier Research and Evaluation](http://outlier.uchicago.edu/), analyzed Code Studio courses 1 and 2 (not courses 3 or 4) lesson completion versus learning gains in K-5 math, reading and science district test scores. The results of the study overall are mixed, yet given that in almost all of the analyses there were **no significant negative relationships**, and the findings provide an indication that **introducing CS into the elementary curriculum does not have a negative effect on test scores in other subject areas**. Future analyses using state test scores will take place by end of year.

- **Significantly positive** relationship between 1st graders taking Course 1 - math scores
- **Significantly negative** relationship between 2nd graders taking Course 1 - math and science scores 
- **Significantly positive** relationship between 2nd graders taking Course 2 - science scores
- **No other significant relationships** between exposure to Code.org lessons and any other outcomes in any grades 1-4
     
Additionally, third party studies into impact of CS on other subjects show promising results:

- A study conducted by College Board (not yet published) shows that students who take the AP Computer Science exam see an improvement in their AP Calculus scores relative to peers who previously had similar math performance. 
- [A study](http://globaloria.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Globaloria_Research_Overview.pdf) conducted by our partner, [Globaloria](http://www.globaloria.com), linked participation in CS courses to significant gains on standardized tests of math and reading in low-income middle school classrooms.
- While students who completed the [Bootstrap](http://bootstrapworld.org) curriculum showed some gains in understanding of mathematical concepts such as functional application and composition, [their recent study](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/sigcse-sfkf.pdf) revealed the challenges of showing direct correlation.
