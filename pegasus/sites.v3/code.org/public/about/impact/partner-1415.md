# [Results and Impact](/about/impact) > District Partnership Program Results, 2014-15

## How successful have our district partnerships been in driving short- and long-term outcomes in each region?

### Summary
Through our district partnerships, we are helping districts increase the priority of Computer Science locally in the face of some big challenges, such as infrastructure, funding, competing grad requirements, and continued teacher development. District planning for sustainability is the current need and focus of future evaluation work.

### Detailed Findings

- Code.org has greatly increased the priority of computer science in the partner districts. 
- District leaders face many challenges in making Computer Science a priority and implementing Code.org, including: getting State-level buy-in, securing the necessary infrastructure and funds, integrating CS into the schedule and graduation requirements, and finding and supporting qualified teachers.
- District leaders see a need to engage the broader local community in this effort, including guidance counselors, higher education institutions and industry.
- Long-term sustainability of gains made through district partnerships is a top concern. Current district leaders do not have actionable plans to sustain their computer science efforts, even though they intend to do so.
