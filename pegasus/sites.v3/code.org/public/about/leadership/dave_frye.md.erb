Dave Frye, Ed.D. is Director of Program Development and Operations at Code.org, leading development and execution of national-level education programs in support of teachers, students, facilitators and our Regional Partner network.  

Dave has over 20 years experience developing strategic, broad-scale initiatives and next-generation education systems that will prepare students for the rapidly changing world in which they will live.  Over the past 5 years, Dave has worked at the intersection of policy, research, and practice to expand opportunities and broaden participation in CS in North Carolina and nationally.  He helped to create and grow the NC CS education initiative, he has led over $5M in CS education research projects, and he has had the good fortune to partner with CS education leaders throughout the country to inform solutions and prototype new ideas for reaching schools and students with relevant, compelling CS opportunities.

He was a member of the committee that developed the CSTA Standards for CS Teachers (2020), provides leadership for NC in the 23-state Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance, and chairs the board of csedreserch.org.  He holds an Ed.D. and M.Ed. in Higher Education Administration from NC State, a B.Mus. in Music Education from Youngstown State University (OH), and an A.A.S in Music from Onondaga Community College (NY).

Dave lives in Raleigh, NC where he likes to spend his energy exploring the world around him and the possibilities it holds with his son Max and wife Carrie.
