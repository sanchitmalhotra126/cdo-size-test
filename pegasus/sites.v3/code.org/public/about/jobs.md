## <a name="data"href="#data">Data Scientist (Seattle, WA or Chicago, IL)</a>

**Job Summary:**

At Code.org we create and support computer science curriculum that reaches millions of students, and we prepare tens of thousands of teachers to begin teaching computer science each year. The core function of the Data Scientist role is to help us gain an increasingly deeper and better understanding of two very important high-level questions: 

- How much are our students learning? (and how can we improve the outcome?)
- How effective is our teacher professional development? (and how can we improve the outcome?)

We already have tons of indicators, stats and data, but these very big questions go beyond a few database queries or analytics stats. Our Code Studio platform has become the most popular coding platform in K-12, and every single line of code written by students contributes to data we could analyze to improve student learning.  We can look at how students and teachers find our courses, how they start them, how they answer each puzzle, the places they solve things correctly, the common mistakes people make, areas students get stuck, and more. 

We’re looking for someone who’s passionate about understanding and using data- someone who wants to ask questions and find answers. Prior experience as a data scientist is a must; educational experience is a plus, but not required. We have lots of education/curriculum experts on the team - we need your help understanding how we can use our data to do more. 

The responsibility in this job isn't just to answer analytic questions but ultimately to help the team improve outcomes for students, teachers, and schools. This role will help establish the questions to ask in the first place, figure out how to answer them, and ensure we are measuring and collecting the right data across our education products, services, and processes.

Job responsibilities will include:

- Helping decide what questions we should be asking of our data
- Analyzing data from the website to understand how we can improve outcomes including:
	- Optimizing courses to be engaging, challenging (but not too challenging) and to increase student learning and coding proficiency outcomes
	- Gaining a deep understanding about our teachers and their experiences in our professional learning programs in order to help them be successful in the classroom
	- Recruiting teachers and students, retaining users, and increasing engagement
- Suggesting new data we can/should collect or experiments we should run
	- Working with others to craft measurement protocols and assessments we can use to track student learning and teacher preparedness
- Writing code/scripts/queries as well as using Tableau (or other tools you recommend) to analyze the data and find answers
- Working with teams across Code.org (product management, professional learning, curriculum, outreach) to design and create actionable dashboards 
- Creating data models to predict outcomes and test experiments 
Generating reports for donors and fundraising purposes
- Collaborating with third party evaluators and external researchers from universities evaluating our work in the classrooms 

**Experience and Qualifications:**

The ideal candidate has a breadth of experience and qualifications:

- A degree in computer science, applied math, or statistics, with multiple years of experience in data and statistical analysis
- Strong analytical skills with attention to detail and the ability to create clear reports to communicate actionable findings to others
- Ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences to fully understand the experiences of our students, teachers, and facilitators resulting in significantly deeper learning and impact.
- A deep familiarity with traditional web-based analytics and data analysis tools - such as Google Analytics, SQL, Redshift, and map reduce. You’ll be working with a Data Engineer on our team who will write production code and implement changes to how we store data from our service. You should be experienced writing scripts to analyze data with at least one analytic programming language (R or Python)
- Knowledge of visualization/analysis tools including Tableau and spreadsheets
- Experience with using web-based analysis and A/B testing to measure/improve online usage
- Experience analyzing data around customer retention and engagement for an online app or website
