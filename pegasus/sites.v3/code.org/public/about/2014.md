# 2014 Annual Report


Dear Code.org friends and fans,

I spent my holidays reflecting on the incredible momentum behind computer science — from hundreds of partners to tens of thousands of educators and schools and millions of students and parents.  

Most people who hear about Code.org see the glitz: the Hour of Code, celebrities, and marketing. Indeed, with the help of the [US President](http://youtu.be/AI_dayIQWV4) and other world leaders, [Anna & Elsa from Frozen](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/103042812198/frozen), and every [Apple](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/post/104341574918/apple) and [Microsoft](https://www.facebook.com/Code.org/photos/a.713452212084418.1073741855.309754825787494/716326561796983/) store, the Hour of Code beat even our wildest expectations.

## Beyond the Hour of Code
But education takes more than an hour. The Hour of Code is just a seed, to show students and their teachers that this is something any child can learn. The bulk of Code.org’s effort goes into follow-up: adding computer science to official curriculum. Here’s my summary of what we achieved in 2014, with your help.

## 1) Bringing fantastic online courses to classrooms  
We’ve developed [100 hours of follow-on curriculum](http://studio.code.org) that’s taught in 90,000 schools worldwide. With *4 million* students enrolled, our courses receive consistently positive feedback. Students love the courses because they feel like play, and feature recognizable characters such as the Angry Birds or Anna & Elsa, and role model lecturers such as Mark Zuckerberg. Teachers appreciate the time we've spent on the pedagogy and classroom testing, and because it's an educational product that engages their students so fully.

## 2) Partnering with school districts, training teachers
We’ve [signed agreements with the largest school districts in the US](/educate/partner-districts) to train their existing staff to teach computer science and to add it to the formal curriculum. Code.org’s awesome partners and Affiliates train 1,000 teachers every month! Our professional development workshops receive rave reviews - 80% of attending teachers say it is the best professional training they've ever received! If you want your local school to participate, write a letter to a teacher or principal. (See [sample letter](/promote/letter))

## 3) Addressing diversity by teaching younger
We all know the tech industry has a workplace diversity problem. Diversity in computer science education is [even worse](http://recode.net/2014/10/01/how-we-solve-the-tech-industrys-gender-gap/). We’re solving it at scale by teaching kids younger and focusing on urban schools. Today only a few thousand female, African American or Hispanic students earn degrees in CS each year. The entire US has only 550,000 female software professionals. By contrast, our intro courses reach *1 million girls and 1 million black and Hispanic students!*

<img width="100%" src="/images/infographics/diversity.png"/>

## 4) Changing state policies to support computer science
Since 2013, our [coalition of advocacy partners](http://computinginthecore.org/) has changed policies in 16 states. We’re proud to say that in [25 states + DC](/action), computer science can finally count for high school graduation. 75% of US students live in these states.

<img width="100%" src="/images/infographics/state-map.png"/>


## 5) International reach
We’ve translated our lessons into 34 languages and established international partnerships in the UK, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Romania, Albania, and the Middle East. If you have some technical proficiency and speak two languages, you can [help us a volunteer translator](/translate). 

<img width="100%" src="/images/infographics/languages.png"/>

Looking to 2015, we have a ton of work ahead, but I’ve also never felt more confident in our ability to realize our vision that every student in every school should have opportunity to study computer science.  


This isn’t just something we do on our own. Our work builds on [decades of effort, by many organizations and individuals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rdEUqAkYtKPMD4UeEmpZCAau4_AdIOGbZDqLkePAQrY/pub) who helped establish, fund, and spread computer science. Our impact is made possible by [generous supporters like you](/about/donors). 


Thank you as always for your support!  If you want to help us, you can ask your school to teach CS ([example letter](/promote/letter)), make a [generous donation](/donate), help [translate our tutorials](/translate), or [help in a variety of other ways](/help).

#moveForward






Launched in 2013, Code.org&reg; is a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. We believe computer science and computer programming should be part of the core curriculum in education, alongside other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, such as biology, physics, chemistry and algebra.

## More information, history, and philosophy
Code.org launched in 2013 as a project of co-founders Ali and Hadi Partovi. Our initial work was a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc) that became #1 on YouTube for a day, and 15,000 schools reached out to us for help. Since then, we've expanded to build a full organization supporting a a worldwide movement. Our goal is for computer science to be a fixed part of school curriculum. 

To support our goal, we do work across the education spectrum: designing our own courses or partnering with others, training teachers, partnering with large school districts, helping change government policies, expanding internationally via partnerships, and marketing to break stereotypes. 

Our work builds upon [decades of effort, by countless organizations and individuals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rdEUqAkYtKPMD4UeEmpZCAau4_AdIOGbZDqLkePAQrY/pub) who have helped establish, fund, and spread computer science education. We're thankful to benefit from the tireless help of the broader computer science education community.

## Donors
Code.org&reg; is a registered public 501c3 nonprofit, with support from the general public. We are grateful for the generous support we’ve received from [individuals and organizations](/about/donors) who support our vision.

Code’s accomplishments (above) demonstrate our ability to leverage those dollars into strong outcomes.  But given our nonprofit ambition that every child in every school should have access to computer science — to become literate citizens in today’s digital world and to test their interests in exploring CS further as a career — we have a long way to go to meet a fundraising goal that will support that vision.

[<button>Make a donation</button>](/donate)&nbsp;&nbsp;or [see our list of donors](/about/donors)

Please [contact us](/contact) if you, your company, or your foundation is interested in talking with our leadership team further to better understand our program and to explore options for investing in our work.
