# Markdown (Title)

## Overview (Heading)

**Markdown** is what we use to edit the Code.org website. (Body text) 


###Syntax (Subheading)

Markdown is very easy to use. Here are examples of basic syntax:

**Bold** text is created using either two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) before and after the text you want to bold. You can also use the shortcut 'Ctrl+B'. 

Example: **The Hour of Code will be during the week of December 7-13, 2015.**

__Last year, 100 million students participated in the Hour of Code.__

*Italic* text is created using one asterisk (*) or one underscore before and after the text you want to make italic. You can also use the shortcut 'Ctrl+I'. 

Example: *Code.org is now working with the College Board to introduce computer science courses at the high level.*

_Code.org and the College will identify and help schools adopt two specific computer science courses at the high school level._

Markdown makes it easy to link to other pages. Our developers make it especially easy to link to other Code.org pages. To link externally, just use square brackets [] to contain the text and round brackets () to contain the html address. 

Example: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_dayIQWV4) is the video of President Obama doing the Hour of Code. 

To link internally to another Code.org webpage, you don't need to include the full link. Just put /webpage inside the round brackets.

Example: [Here](/promote) are statistics about computer science education today. [Here](/help) is how you can help us improve those stats. 

Linking to an email address is easy. Example: <support@code.org>.

You can create unordered lists in two ways, using either an asterisk (*) or a hyphen (-) followed by a space. Make sure to leave a row bewteen your headline and the list. 

Example: **Code.org and the College Board will facilitate high schools offering the following courses:**

* Exploring Computer Science: A course accessible for all students, designed to stimulate interest in the field and instill the basic knowledge and skills essential for subsequent enrollment in related AP courses.

- APÂ® Computer Science Principles: A new AP course that will debut in fall 2016, providing students with the chance to earn college credit for mastery of an array of computing principles and activities.

Ordered lists are created using "1." + space. 

Example: **Top three numbers to know about computer science education.**

1. In 25 of 50 states, computer science classes can't count toward math or science graduation requirements. 
2. In 2020, 1.4 million computer science jobs will be available. 
3. But only 400,000 computer science students will graduate that year. 


A basic table in markdown is created like this:
