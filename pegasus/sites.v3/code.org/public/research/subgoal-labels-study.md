# Invitation to Participate: Subgoal Labels Study
Teachers who use Code.org Computer Science Principles curriculum are invited to participate in a research study that could help Code.org improve their curriculum and contribute to best practices in computer science education. ** The study will determine the effects of using a learning mechanism called *“subgoal labels”* when learning programming. **
Prior research across a variety of disciplines such as statistics, algebra and chemistry suggests that using *subgoal labels* improves students’ problem solving abilities by helping to break down problems into manageable parts. 
The study is being conducted as part of continuing research by [Dr. Briana Morrison from the University of Nebraska at Omaha](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/about/faculty-staff/briana-morrison.php).## Why you should participate:
Besides helping inform best practices in computer science education, **your participation may improve your students’ performance**.  In preliminary research in computing classes, students who learn using subgoal labels have been shown to:
* Perform 10-15% better on problem solving tasks (this is the equivalent of a letter grade on a test)
* Retain more knowledge over time
* Because of more efficient learning, complete problem solving tasks in less timeBut we need your help to verify these initial results with a wide range of students.

The researchers have worked with Code.org to include *subgoal label* usage in a version of **Unit 3 of the CSP curriculum.**  
**There is no different, or additional teacher prep required.** 
The vast majority of the unit is the same. The differences pertain to how some material is presented to students through App Lab – the Code.org programming interface.Of those who opt in to participate in the study, a number of those teachers and their classes will be randomly selected to receive the subgoal intervention. Others will receive a redesigned version of the unit without the intervention. This type of blind experiment is important for scientific rigor.  Students in your classes will all see the same thing – your students won’t be split between different versions of the study. By opting in, your students will be automatically routed to the appropriate version of unit 3.  The difference should be transparent for your students except you and they will see a URL that indicates you are using the research version of unit 3 (e.g.  https://studio.code.org/s/csp3-research-abc123).You may be asked to provide feedback on how you perceive your students are doing with learning unit 3, and we may ask you additional demographic data about your class.## Data collection and protection:
Code.org does not store student contact information on its servers. All student activity data collected by Code.org is anonymized with randomly generated student ids and further stripped of any identifying information before sharing it for research purposes. 
No results will ever be tied back to any individual student, teacher or school.  Any data collected directly by the researchers will have no identifying information – only data that will be aggregated for research purposes. 
The researchers will never have direct access to any student generated data – only aggregated data prepared and cleaned by Code.org. An example of this might be how many students per class get a specific question correct on the first try. While data might be aggregated and generalized based on class groupings, there will be no way to know the identity of a student who got the question right or wrong, nor the identity of the class they were part of, nor the identity of their teacher.
