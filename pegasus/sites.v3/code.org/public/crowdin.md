# Translating the site and tutorials
The majority of our translations are done through CrowdIn, a localization management platform. It is free to join and any volunteer can immediately contribute to the project by providing translations. 

There are currently three projects, the [Code.org Project](https://crowdin.com/project/codeorg), [Hour of Code Project](https://crowdin.com/project/hour-of-code), and [Curriculum Project](https://crowdin.com/project/lesson-plans). Please complete translations for these projects in that order of priority. If you have completed translations (at least 75% of the project is complete) and do not see your language in the drop down menu, please send a report to translations@code.org.


## How translations are selected

Members of the project are either a translator or proofreader. A translator can provide translations, while a proofreader can both provide translations as well as select the best translation to be used on the site.

The final translation that appears on our site is selected as follows:

1. A proofreader selects the best translation.
2. If there is no translation selected by a proofreader, translators vote on the best translation and the translation with the most votes is selected.
3. if votes are tied, the most recent translation will be selected.

## Tips and Guidelines for Consistent Translations
The Code.org drag-drop tutorials are based on the Blockly language. Many of the tips below are loosely based on the wiki article [Translating:Blockly](http://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Blockly)

### Be Gender Neutral
The target audience for drag-drop programming is individual or small groups of children, aged 8+. Please use gender-neutral forms if possible in your language.

### Keep Spanish General
There are several languages with multiple dialects, but please keep Spanish and other such languages in a general form that will be universally understandable by all dialects.

### Avoid Technical Jargon
Our tutorials are meant for beginners, so please avoid technical jargon. It is **far** more important that language be clear to beginners than for it to match what experienced programmers might use. For example, Blockly uses the term "text" instead of "string", and we use "list" instead of "array". Also, Blockly uses 1-based indexing instead of the more common 0-based indexing.

### Review The CrowdIn Glossary
Consistency is important. In English, for example, we have gone back and forth on whether to use the term "function" or "procedure". What is more important than which term is chosen is that the same term is used throughout. Inside the CrowdIn interface, click the "Terminology" tab to see what the key terms are. These are the ones that need to be translated consistently within each language.

### Untranslatable Symbols
If any mathematical (or other) symbols are inappropriate in your language but are not offered for customization, please let us know by contacting translations@code.org.

### Translate Text, Not Code
Code that shows up in peach or green like `var x = 2;`, `&quot;`, `%{keyword}` should not be translated. There is also the case when you might see text such as `{ outside text { inside text } outside text }`. Notice the two sets of curly braces. Translate the inside text, but do not translate the outside text. And for consistency, leep the same capitalization and punctuation of our strings.

### Use Informal Style
The tone is informal and conversational, and we prefer short phrases to long ones, such as "if path ahead" instead of "if there is a path ahead". Translations do not need to be exact.

### CrowdIn Etiquette
As a translator, please do not submit a translation that is identical to another user's submission. If you think a proofreader has made a mistake, please leave a comment in the comment section to bring it to their attention. As a proofreader, please do not delete translations.
