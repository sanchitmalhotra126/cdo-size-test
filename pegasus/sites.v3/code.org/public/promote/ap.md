# Dig Deeper into AP Computer Science

The AP Computer Science exams are widely accepted by the computer science education community as one of the most reliable measures of computer science high school course-taking patterns. The College Board’s rigorous methodology and data gathering has enabled us to see trends in AP Computer Science A exam-taking over time, by state, by gender, and by ethnic group; as well as the impact of AP Computer Science Principles course, which launched in the 2016-17 school year. This page contains a summary of that data.

This data comes directly from the public spreadsheets available on a per-state basis from the [College Board](https://research.collegeboard.org/programs/ap/data).

_Change in ethnic group categories: In 2016, the College Board changed the ethnic group categories that they report. Prior to 2016, we considered the following to be underrepresented minority groups: American Indian, Black, Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Other Hispanic. After 2016, we considered the following categories: American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander._

## 2017 Outcomes

### General

#### _The total <strong>number of students in CS increased</strong> as compared to 2016:_
* CS A: +1709 exams, or +3%
* CS P: 43,780 exams
* All CS Exams: +45,489 exams, or +84%

#### _<strong>Female student participation in CS increased</strong> as compared to 2016:_
* CS A: +525 exams, or +4%
* CS P: 13,172 exams
* All CS Exams: +13,697 exams, or +108% _(CS P is the main reason for overall increase)_

#### _<strong>Underrepresented minority student participation in CS increased</strong> as compared to 2016:_
* CS A: +314 exams, or +4%
* CS P: 11,417 exams
* All CS Exams: +11,731 exams, or +139% _(CS P is the main reason for overall increase)_

#### _<strong>CS passing rates (score 3+) were lower for female and underrepresented minority students</strong> in 2017._
* All CS Exams: female student passing rate was 67% (-4% as compared to male students)
* All CS Exams: underrepresented minority student passing rate was 49% (-27% as compared to the students in the majority)

#### _<strong>All states (+ DC) saw an increase in the number of total CS exams</strong> taken in 2017, due to the addition of CS Principles._
* CS A: 20 states saw a decrease in CS A exams
* CS P: All states but Montana offered CS P

#### _<strong>Schools that offered CS increased</strong> as compared to 2016:_

* CS P: 2,625 schools
* All CS Exams: +59% (4,810 schools to 7,665 schools). _(However, it’s unclear what percent of schools offer both CS A and CS P)_


### Female student participation

#### _Female students <strong>comprised a low percent of AP CS exams</strong>:_
* CS A: 23% of exams were taken by female students. This is 0% change from 2016 and is the lowest rate of female student participation for any AP Exam (same as 2016)
* CS P: 30% of exams were taken by female students. This is the 4th lowest rate of female participation for any AP exam (Physics and CS A have lower rates)
* All CS Exams: 26% of all CS exams were taken by female students

#### _Female student <strong>passing rate was lower than male students</strong>:_
* CS A: female student passing rate was 64% of exams (lower than male students by -3.8% passing rate and a mean score difference of -0.13)
* CS P: female student passing rate was 70% of exams (lower than male students by -6% passing rate and a mean score difference of -0.15)
* All CS Exams: female student passing rate of exams was 67% (lower than male students by -4% passing rate)


### Underrepresented minority student participation

For 2017 College Board data, we consider the following ethnic group categories to be underrepresented minorities: American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander. (Other categories reported by the College Board are Asian, White, Two or more races, Other, and No response.) Note that until 2016, the College Board reported demographics using different categories; for those years, the following ethnic group categories are considered to be underrepresented minorities: American Indian, Black, Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Other Hispanic. (Other ethnic categories reported by the College Board include Asian, White, Other, and Not stated.) The majority is defined as White and Asian students.

#### _Underrepresented minority students <strong>comprised a low percent of AP CS exams</strong>:_
* CS A: 16% of exams were taken by underrepresented minority students. This is the 7th lowest rate of participation for any AP exam (calculus, physics and languages have lower rates) and 4th lowest in AP STEM exams.
* CS P: 26% of exams were taken by underrepresented minority students. This is the 2nd highest rate of underrepresented minority student participation across STEM AP exams (Environmental Science is higher at 28%).
* All CS Exams: 20% of all CS exams were taken by underrepresented minority students.

#### _Underrepresented minority student <strong>passing rate was lower than the students in the majority</strong>:_
* CS A: underrepresented minority student passing rate was 44% of exams (lower than the students in the majority by -28%). Black students scored lower at an average score of 2.08, with a mean difference of 1.40 as compared to students in the majority.
* CS P: underrepresented minority student passing rate was 53% of exams (lower than the students in the majority by -29%). Black students scored lower at an average score of 2.32, with a mean difference of 1.15 as compared to the students in the majority.
* All CS Exams: underrepresented minority student passing rate of exams was 49% (lower than students in the majority by 27%).
