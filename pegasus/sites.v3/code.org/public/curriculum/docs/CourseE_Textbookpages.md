### Markdown for embedded artist

#### Ready... Set... Draw!

Here's an example of a drawing that you're about to create yourself! 

Run through it one or two times so that you know what to expect.

**Some fun punny things for Frozen**

- Freeze! Here's an example...
- Do you wanna build a snowflake? ...
- Cool off with this new drawing ...

### Markdown for embedded Play Lab

#### Ready... Set... Play!

Here's an example of a game that you're about to create yourself! 

Play through it one or two times so that you know what to expect.

### Markdown for concept textbook pages

All in one place for now, will be split up at horizontal lines for each concept

------

1. Algorithms

------

### In this lesson...

Have you ever wanted to tell someone exactly what to do? Do they always listen to you?

Today, you'll be telling a machine what to do, step by step- and it will listen!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml>when run</xml><xml>move forward</xml>

### You just learned "algorithms"!

**An algorithm is just a list of steps to finish a task**. The fun thing about algorithms is that you get to decide what happens, step by step. 

When you write an algorithm for a machine, this is called a **program**. 

#### Vocab to Know

Algorithm

- A list of steps to finish a task

Program

- An algorithm that has been coded into something that can be run by a machine

#### Up Next

Be careful! If your steps aren't just right, some bugs might crawl their way into your program.

2. Debugging

------

### In this lesson...

What do you think of when you think about bugs? 

When most people think about bugs, they think about creepy crawly things. In computer science, bugs aren't alive, but they can still be tricky.

The puzzles in this lesson have already been solved for you! **But not so fast**- they don't seem to be working yet. Are bugs behind all this? 

------

### You just learned about "bugs"!

**A bug is something that goes wrong.** It is an error in a program. When you find and fix those errors, you are **debugging** a problem. 

You have to practice **persistence**, another word for not giving up, in order to find and fix all the bugs.

Remember, debugging is a process:

1. Recognize that there is an error in your program. 
2. Work through the program step by step to find the error.
3. Try the first step- does it work?
4. Try the second step- how about now?
5. When you find where your bug is, you can work to fix, or debug, it!

#### Vocab to Know

Bug

- Part of a program that does not work correctly

Debugging

- Finding and fixing problems in an algorithm or program

Persistence

- Not giving up

#### Up Next

Have you ever wanted to repeat something over and over? Ever wish there was an easy way to do that? Your wait is almost over!

3. Loops

------

### In this lesson...

How would you move your character forward **5** times? This would be pretty easy- just drag out **5** move forward blocks. Now, imagine you want your character to move forward **5,000** times! 

How long would it take you to drag out **5,000** blocks? 

Wish there was an easy way to do this? There is!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml>repeat ??? times</xml>

------

### You just learned "loops"!

**A loop is the action of doing something over and over again.** Another word for doing something again is **repeat**.

**Pro Tip** (orange)

Loops are really useful for repeating patterns. It might be helpful to write out your program without any loops first, then try to find a pattern. 

When you see one, stick that pattern into a `repeat` block!

#### Vocab to Know

Loop

- The action of doing something over and over again

Repeat

- Do something again

#### Up Next

This might blow your mind... what would happen if you put a loop *inside another loop*?!



------

4. Nested Loops

------

### In this lesson...

Have you ever wondered what would happen if you put a loop *inside another loop*? 

It might just make you go loopy!

If a normal loop is good at repeating patterns, what do you think a loop inside another loop would be good at? Let's find out!

#### Blocks to Know

<gif>Repeat 4 times, repeat move forward 10 times, turn right (gif of it running so you can see the yellow highlight moving to show order of execution)</gif>

------

### You just learned "nested loops"!

**A nested loop is a loop within a loop.** Think of it like an outer loop, with another loop that got all comfy and cozy and nested inside the outer loop. 

Nested loops are great for repeating patterns of patterns. They can be very powerful if used correctly!

#### Words to Know

Nested Loop

- A loop within a loop

#### Up Next

Have you ever heard someone say "under one condition"? What does it mean? Can you think of a way this can be used in computer science?



------

6. Conditionals

------

### In this lesson...

"The class gets five minutes of extra recess under one condition- you all have to finish your worksheets." If your teacher said this, it means that *while* everyone *meets the condition* and finishes their worksheets, then everyone gets five extra minutes of recess. 

You can use this idea in computer science too! Let's get started!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml> While there is lettuce </xml> </xml> Repeat until there is lettuce </xml>

------

### You just learned "conditionals"!

**A *conditional* is a statement that only runs under a certain condition.** 

A *condition* is a statement that a program checks to see if it is true or false. If true, an action is taken. Otherwise, the action is ignored.

Conditionals are very useful in computer science. When you try to log in to your favorite website, the website is using conditionals! 

*If* the password you entered matches the password it has saved for you, log in!

#### Vocab to Know

Condition

- A statement that a program checks to see if it is true or false

Conditionals

- Statements that only run under certain conditions
