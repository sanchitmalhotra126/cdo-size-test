1. Algorithms

-----

###In this lesson...

Have you ever wanted to tell someone exactly what to do? Do they always listen to you?

Today, you'll be telling a machine what to do, step by step- and it will listen!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml>when run</xml><xml>move forward</xml>

-----

###You just learned "algorithms"!

**An algorithm is just a list of steps to finish a task**. The fun thing about algorithms is that you get to decide what happens, step by step. 

When you write an algorithm for a machine, this is called a **program**. 

#### Vocab to Know

Algorithm

- A list of steps to finish a task

Program

* An algorithm that has been coded into something that can be run by a machine

####Up Next 

Be careful! If your steps aren't just right, some bugs might crawl their way into your program.

2. Debugging

------

###In this lesson...

What do you think of when you think about bugs? 

When most people think about bugs, they think about creepy crawly things. In computer science, bugs aren't alive, but they can still be tricky.

The puzzles in this lesson have already been solved for you! But not so fast- they don't seem to be working yet. Are bugs behind all this? 

-----

###You just learned about "bugs"!

**A bug is something that goes wrong.** It is an error in a program. When you find and fix those errors, you are **debugging** a problem. 

You have to practice **persistence**, another word for not giving up, in order to find and fix all the bugs.

Remember, debugging is a process:

1. Recognize that there is an error in your program. 
2. Work through the program step by step to find the error.
3. Try the first step- does it work?
4. Try the second step- how about now?
5. When you find where your bug is, you can work to fix, or debug, it!

#### Vocab to Know

Bug

- Part of a program that does not work correctly

Debugging

- Finding and fixing problems in an algorithm or program

Persistence

- Not giving up

3. Loops

------

### In this lesson...

Imagine you want your character to move forward **5** times. This would be pretty easy- just drag out **5** move forward blocks. Now, imagine you want your character to move forward **5,000** times! 

How long would it take you to drag out **5,000** blocks? 

Wish there was an easy way to do this? There is!

####Blocks to Know

<xml>repeat ??? times</xml>

###You just learned "loops"!

**A loop is the action of doing something over and over again.** Another word for doing something again is repeat.

**Pro Tip** (orange)

Loops are really useful for repeating patterns. It might be helpful to write out your program without any loops first, then try to find a pattern. 

When you see one, stick that pattern into a `repeat` block!

#### Vocab to Know

Loop

- The action of doing something over and over again

Repeat

- Do something again

#### Up Next

This might blow your mind... what would happen if you put a loop *inside another loop*?!



------

4. Nested Loops

------

### In this lesson...

Have you ever wondered what would happen if you put a loop *inside another loop*? 

It might just make you go loopy!

If a normal loop is good at repeating patterns, what do you think a loop inside another loop would be good at? Let's find out!

#### Blocks to Know

<gif>Repeat 4 times, repeat move forward 10 times, turn right (gif of it running so you can see the yellow highlight moving to show order of execution)</gif>

---

### You just learned "nested loops"!

**A nested loop is a loop within a loop.** Think of it like an outer loop, with another loop that got all comfy and cozy and nested inside the outer loop. 

Nested loops are great for repeating patterns of patterns. They can be very powerful if used correctly!

#### Words to Know

Nested Loop

- A loop within a loop

#### Up Next

Right now, all of the code is running when you press the Run button. Have you ever wondered how you could get your character to move when something else happens?



------

6. Events

------

### In this lesson...

Think about your favorite video game. How do you control it? It probably uses arrow keys, a controller, or even your finger. 

Does the game know at what time the user will press and arrow key or move the controller? 

No! The game only knows what to do *when* the user does something. 

What if you wanted to make different code run when something new happens, just like your favorite video game? Let's find out!

#### Blocks to Know

<xml>When left arrow</xml> <xml>When actor 1 touches actor 2</xml>

---

###You just learned "events"!

**An event is an action that causes something to happen.**

Events help us write programs that can respond to different actions. They are very important in computer science because programs can change when new users use them.

#### Words to Know

Event

- An action that causes something to happen

#### Up Next

Have you ever heard the phrase "under one condition"? What does it mean? Can you think of a way this can be used in computer science?



------

8. Conditionals

------

### In this lesson...

"The class gets five minutes of extra recess under one condition- you all have to finish your worksheets." If your teacher said this, it means that *if* everyone finishes their worksheets, then everyone gets five extra minutes of recess. 

You can use this idea in computer science too! *If* your character hits a zombie, get one point. *If* your character finds a tree, cut it down. 

The possibilities are endless! Let's get started!

####Blocks to Know

<xml> If lava ahead </xml>

---

###You just learned "conditionals"!

**A *conditional* is a statement that only runs under a certain condition.** 

A *condition* is a statement that a program checks to see if it is true or false. If true, an action is taken. Otherwise, the action is ignored.

Conditionals are super useful in computer science. Imagine logging in to your favorite website and typing in your password. The website has to use conditionals to check *if* the password you entered matches the password it has saved for your username. *If* it matches, log in! *Else*, give the user an error. 

#### Vocab to Know

Condition

- A statement that a program checks to see if it is true or false

Conditionals

* Statements that only run under certain conditions

#### Up Next

Coming your way- ways to store information in your program so you can reuse it later.

9. Variables

------

### In this lesson...

Imagine you are trying to write a program that adds two numbers together. It would be no fun if the program added the same two numbers together every time. 

If we have a way to tell the program to always add the first number to the second number, no matter what the numbers are, wouldn't that be helpful?

#### Blocks to Know

<xml>Set number1 to 5</xml><xml>Set number2 to 3</xml>

<xml>number1 + number2</xml>

---

### You just learned "variables"!

**A variable is a placeholder for a piece of information that can change.** Variables can be helpful when you don't know what certain information will be until you press Run and the user is interacting with your program. 

In order to use a variable, it needs a name and a value. The name never changes, but the value can. This way you can just use the name of the variable as a placeholder wherever you want in your program! 

Now, when the value changes, you only have to change the value in one place.

#### Vocab to Know

Variable

- A placeholder for a piece of information that can change

#### Up Next

Repeat loops- but with more control.



------

12. For Loops

------

### In this lesson...

Sometimes you might want to repeat things over and over, but also want to keep track of how many time you have repeated it already. Sometimes, you don't want to start at one and count by ones. 

Today you'll be learning about a new kind of `repeat` loop. Here is a preview of the block you'll be using:

![](https://code.org/curriculum/course4/8/loop.png)

*For*tunately, this new loop will make solving puzzles like this really easy!

<screengrab or gif>https://studio.code.org/s/coursef/stage/19/puzzle/5 puzzle </gif>

---

###You just learned "for loops"!

**For loops are loops where you set the beginning, end, and step values.** 

This new kind of `repeat` loop gives you more control over:

1. When your loop starts
2. When your loop ends
3. What your loop should increase by every time it runs

More control means you can solve puzzles a lot faster! 

#### Vocab to Know

For Loop

- For loops are loops that have a predetermined beginning, end, and increment (step interval)

#### Up Next

You will get to learn how to make... drumroll please... your own blocks!

22. Functions

------

### In this lesson...

Have you ever wanted to create your own blocks? Today is your lucky day! 

You will learn how to create your own blocks, and make up what should happen when your new block is run. 

Then, you can use this new block wherever you want, however many times you want!

####Blocks to Know

<xml> gray function box with green "do something" function inside, "move forward 5 times" block inside that </xml>

<xml> single green "do something" block in between turn left and turn right blocks</xml>

---

###You just learned "functions"!

**A function is a named group of programming instructions. **

Functions are really helpful in computer science because you get to define what happens when you call it, and you can call it from anywhere in your program! 

You can put whatever you need to inside of functions, including: loops, actions, conditionals, and sometimes even *other functions*!

Hope you had *fun* with *fun*ctions!

#### Vocab to Know

Function

- A named group of programming instructions. Functions are reusable abstractions that reduce the complexity of writing and maintaining programs

#### Up Next

Functions: leveled up!

15. Functions with Parameters

------

### In this lesson...

Now that you know all about functions, what if you wanted to customize it some more? 

Imagine that you want to create a function that will draw triangles. You want to draw lots of triangles, but in different colors. 

Right now, you would have to make a separate function for each different colored triangle. Today you'll learn how to fix this problem!

#### Blocks to Know

Function editor

<gif> function editor opening with draw triangle, color parameter </gif>

New function block

<gif> green draw triangle function block with color block being passed in</gif>

---

###You just learned "parameters"!

**A parameter is an extra piece of information passed to a function to customize it for a specific need.** 

Parameters are really helpful when you want to reuse code in different places, but want something a little bit different to happen every time you "call" your function. This makes parameters a really powerful tool in computer science.

Hope you had fun *para*ding around your new tool: *para*meters!

#### Words to Know

Function

- A named group of programming instructions

Parameter

- An extra piece of information passed to a function to customize it for a specific need
