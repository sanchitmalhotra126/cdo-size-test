# Code.org Advocacy Coalition
The Code.org Advocacy Coalition is a non-partisan group of organizations that believe K-12 computer science should be part of the core curriculum in education, and that we must expand opportunities for girls and underrepresented students of color. 
## State Policy 
We support the implementation of the eight following policies to make computer science fundamental in K-12: 

* Define computer science and establish rigorous K-12 computer science standards
* Allocate funding for rigorous computer science professional development and course support 
* Implement clear certification pathways for computer science teachers
* Create incentives at institutions of higher education to offer computer science to pre-service teachers
* Establish dedicated computer science positions in state and local education authorities
* Require that all secondary schools offer computer science with appropriate implementation timelines
* Allow computer science to count for mathematics or science graduation requirements
* Allow computer science to count as a mathematics or science admissions requirement at institutions of higher education.
