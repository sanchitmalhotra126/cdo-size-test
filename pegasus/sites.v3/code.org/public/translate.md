# Help us translate Code.org

We want help translating the Code.org web site, tutorials, and videos. To sign up, please [fill out this form](http://eepurl.com/Im_In).

## Tips for Translating
The Code.org drag-drop tutorials are based on the Blockly language. Many of the tips below are loosely based on the wiki article [Translating:Blockly](http://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Blockly)

### Use Informal Style
The tone is informal and conversational, and we prefer short phrases to long ones, such as "if path ahead" instead of "if there is a path ahead". Translations do not need to be exact.

### Be Gender Neutral
The target audience for drag-drop programming is individual or small groups of children, aged 8+. Please use gender-neutral forms if possible in your language.

### Avoid Technical Jargon
Our tutorials are meant for beginners, so please avoid technical jargon. It is **far** more important that language be clear to beginners than for it to match what experienced programmers might use. For example, Blockly uses the term "text" instead of "string", and we use "list" instead of "array". Also, Blockly uses 1-based indexing instead of the more common 0-based indexing.

### Review The CrowdIn Glossary
Consistency is important. In English, for example, we have gone back and forth on whether to use the term "function" or "procedure". What is more important than which term is chosen is that the same term is used throughout. Inside the CrowdIn interface, click the "Terminology" tab to see what the key terms are. These are the ones that need to be translated consistently within each language.

### Untranslatable Symbols
If any mathematical (or other) symbols are inappropriate in your language but are not offered for customization, please let us know by contacting translations@code.org.

### Translate Text, Not Code
Code that shows up in peach or green like `var x = 2;`, `&quot;`, `%{keyword}` should not be translated. There is also the case when you might see text such as `{ outside text { inside text } outside text }`. Notice the two sets of curly braces. Translate the inside text, but do not translate the outside text. And for consistency, leep the same capitalization and punctuation of our strings.
