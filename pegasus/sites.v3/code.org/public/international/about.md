# About Us

Code.orgÂ® is a nonprofit dedicated to expanding access to computer science in schools and increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities. Our vision is that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science, just like biology, chemistry or algebra. Code.org provides the leading curriculum for K-12 computer science in the largest school districts in the United States and Code.org also organizes the annual [Hour of Code](hourofcode.com) campaign which has engaged 10% of all students in the world. Code.org is supported by generous donors including Amazon, Facebook, Google, the Infosys Foundation, Microsoft, and [many more](/about/donors).

## History 

In 2013, Code.org was launched by twin brothers Hadi and Ali Partovi with a video promoting computer science. This video became #1 on YouTube for a day, and 15,000 schools reached out to us for help. Since then, we've expanded from a bootstrapped staff of volunteers to build a full organization supporting a worldwide movement. We believe that a quality computer science education should be available to every child, not just a lucky few.

## What We Do

We do work across the education spectrum: designing our own courses or partnering with others, training teachers, partnering with large school districts, helping change government policies, expanding internationally via partnerships, and marketing to break stereotypes. Our work builds upon decades of effort, by countless organizations and individuals who have helped establish, fund, and spread computer science education. We're thankful to benefit from the tireless help of the broader computer science education community, and we thank all the partners and individuals who have supported our impact over the years.
