# International Program
## Let’s work together to spread the word about computer science education around the world! 

We’ve seen incredible enthusiasm from the international community to further Code.org’s mission to give every student in every school the opportunity to learn computer science (CS)! We are excited to explore opportunities to collaborate more closely with our supporters abroad. 

Through partnerships with organizations outside of the U.S., Code.org’s International Program aims to:

* Promote the worldwide expansion of CS education
* Build global communities of CS education champions
* Enable and empower partnering organizations to cultivate enthusiastic and competent CS teachers across the world
* Provide Code.org content to a global audience
