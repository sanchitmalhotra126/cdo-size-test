# The Circuit Playground

The Circuit Playground is a small microcontroller board with LEDs, buttons, and sensors built in. Based on the popular Arduino platform, the Circuit Playground enables students to get up and running quickly with physical computing without worrying about many of the traditional barriers to entry. Developed by our friends at [Adafruit](//adafruit.com), the Circuit Playground is the core tool used in CS Discoveries Unit 6, Physical Computing.

## <a name="how"></a>Programming with the Circuit Playground

Being based on the Arduino means that there are many options for programming the Circuit Playground, including using the standard Arduino IDE. Code.org, however, has developed a special set of commands for <a href="/applab/">App Lab</a>, our block-to-text app development environment, called the Maker Toolkit. Using App Lab and the Maker Toolkit, students can quickly build apps that communicate with external hardware using the same language and environment they've already become comfortable with.

## <a name="requirements"></a>Software Requirements

One of our primary goals in integrating the Circuit Playground into CS Discoveries is to remove the barriers that teachers often encounter attempting to teach physical computing. To that end, we've developed a system that requires only minimal software installation. At present, the Maker Toolkit requires the following software:

* Google Chrome
* [The Code.org Maker Toolkit Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codeorg-serial-connector/ncmmhcpckfejllekofcacodljhdhibkg)
* The Arduino drive (required by Windows only)

Please note that due to changes Google is implementing in Chrome, we are at present working on an alternative approach to connecting to the Circuit Playground. More details will be posted here when available.

### <a name="difference"></a>Whatâ€™s the difference between App Lab, Circuit Playground, and Maker Toolkit?

**App Lab** is a web-based programming environment for building apps using Javascript with either blocks or text. App Lab features prominently in both CS Principles and CS Discoveries

The **Circuit Playground** is an Arduino-based circuit board produced by Adafruit. It has a variety of sensors and ouputs built in.

The **Maker Toolkit** is an additional set of commands in App Lab that allow you to communicate with and control a Circuit Playground plugged into USB. You can enable the Maker Toolkit in any App Lab project by clicking the settings gear above the toolbox and selecting "Enable Maker Toolkit [BETA]."
