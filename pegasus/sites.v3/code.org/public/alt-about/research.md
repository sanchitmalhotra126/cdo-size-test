<p>A growing body of evidence supports the idea that learning computer science helps students far beyond the direct benefits of digital literacy or careers in tech. Recent research demonstrates that a good computer science education can increase reading comprehension and improve students’ problem-solving and planning skills. Students who take CS in high school are likelier to enroll in college, and students who major in CS are among the highest paying university graduates, earning <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/career_earnings_by_college_major/">40% more than average university graduates</a>.</p>
<p>The research, program evaluations, and case studies listed on this page measure and evaluate the effectiveness of Code.org programs, including course content, student progress, professional development for teachers, district implementation, and the Hour of Code.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131520300099?dgcid=author">The effects of coding on children’s planning and inhibition skills</a></strong></h3>
<p>In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, Arfé, Vardanega, and Ronconi examined how 1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses.</p>

<p>Research conducted with 3rd-5th-grade students in Broward County found that students who did extra Code.org CS Fundamentals activities, in classrooms of teachers who reported high levels of resourcefulness, had significantly higher scores on the Achieve3000 reading comprehension exam. They also scored significantly higher on Florida State Math, Science, and English Language Arts Exams.</p>

<p>Brown found “substantial and significant increases” in students taking and earning a qualifying score on the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles exam when their teacher had participated in Code.org’s Professional Learning Program.

<p>In two years more than one million Italian students have been engaged and have completed a total of 10 million hours of informatics using Code.org materials in schools. A detailed analysis of quantitative and qualitative data about the project corroborates the hypothesis that an exposure to informatics at an early age is important to attract students no matter their gender.</p>

<p>Findings show that after completing one Hour of Code activity students report liking computer science more, feel that they are better able to learn computer science, and are better at computer science than their peers. These study results suggest that simple exposure to computer science, with the right activity, may be a critical first step to engage more students—especially girls, in computer science.</p>

## Program Evaluations

<h3><strong><a href="https://code.org/files/EvaluationReport2015-16.pdf">Evaluation Summary Report 2015-2016</a></strong></h3>
<p>Code.org’s elementary, middle, and high School programs for teachers and students are evaluated with the following three questions in mind: What impact does Code.org professional development and use of Code.org curricula have on teachers? What impact does Code.org curriculum have on student proficiency and learning of computer science? Is teacher and student participation in Code.org programs associated with changes in their attitudes toward and self-efficacy with computer science?</p>

<p>Outlier Research and Evaluation worked closely with Code.org staff to evaluate professional development (PD) implementation; teacher satisfaction with PD; program (course) implementation; and teacher attitudinal outcomes, as a first step in a larger evaluation effort. The evaluation thus focused on supporting program improvements; documenting the extent to which Code.org was reaching its desired short-term outcomes; and data-informed recommendations for realizing short and long-term goals.</p>

## Case Studies
<p>Code.org has partnered with a number of districts across the US to develop implementation plans for bringing CS to schools district-wide and to offer professional development to teachers. Although we no longer partner directly with school districts, we do offer partnerships through our Regional Partners. Regional Partners are K-12 computer science hubs for their regions, offering professional learning opportunities for teachers, collaborating on implementation plans, and building strong local communities. To learn more, visit our <a href="https://code.org/educate/regional-partner">Regional Partner Program page</a> or <a href="https://code.org/educate/professional-learning/contact-regional-partner">connect directly with your local Regional Partner</a>.</p>
