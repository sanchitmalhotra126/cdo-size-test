Whether itâ€™s organizing the worldwide Hour of Code, advocating for policy change in statehouses across the US, developing curriculum, or preparing teachers to bring CS into their classrooms, Code.org has impacted [every part of the education system](/alt-about#work) in its mission to get computer science access to all students. Below is a high-level overview--you can go deeper with our [Annual Report](/about/2019), or see all the stats and research on our [Research](/research) page.

  <p>Since 2013, the percentage of young women and students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in Code.org classrooms has increased by xxxxx%, nearly matching US demographics. And because Code.org classrooms represent around 40% of all CS classrooms in the US, percentages overall have increased, too!</p>

## Our History and Philosophy

<div style="padding-right: 20px; float: left; margin-top: 10px">
  <%= view :display_video_thumbnail, id: 'teach_cs', video_code: 'nKIu9yen5nc', play_button: 'center', letterbox: 'false'%>
</div>
  <p>In 2013, Code.org was launched by twin brothers <a href="https://code.org/about/leadership/hadi_partovi">Hadi</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ali-partovi#/entity">Ali Partovi</a> with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc">video</a> promoting computer science. This video became #1 on YouTube for a day, and 15,000 schools reached out to us for help. Since then, we've expanded from a bootstrapped staff of volunteers to build a full organization supporting a worldwide movement. We believe that a quality computer science education should be available to every child, not just a lucky few.</p>
  <p>To support our goal, we do work across the education spectrum: designing our own courses or partnering with others, training teachers, partnering with large school districts, helping change government policies, expanding internationally via partnerships, and marketing to break stereotypes.</p>
  <p>Our work builds upon <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rdEUqAkYtKPMD4UeEmpZCAau4_AdIOGbZDqLkePAQrY/pub">decades of effort, by countless organizations and individuals</a> who have helped establish, fund, and spread computer science education. We're thankful to benefit from the tireless help of the broader computer science education community, and <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/dedicating-our-5-year-anniversary-to-our-partners-b57368a92924">we thank all the partners and individuals who have supported our impact over the years</a>.</p>
