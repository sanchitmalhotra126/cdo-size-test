# Help AP Computer Science count for graduation in YOUR school

The College Board, Code.org, CSTA, and a coalition of partners spent the last year helping states revise or enact policies to allow computer science to count towards high school math or science graduation requirements. Research has shown that students are more likely to try computer science when it is part of the academic pathway rather than an elective. And CS teachers have told us their work is valued more as well when it’s categorized this way. 

According to Massachusetts State Statute, each local school districts has the authority to establish its own high school <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/graduation.html"_blank">graduation requirements</a> to exceed the minimum expectations outlined in the state graduation guidelines. 

This policy indicates that districts can count computer science towards graduation requirements in Massachusetts. To ensure all students have access to computer science education, **please use the sample letter text below to urge your principal or district superintendent to implement this change.**

## A letter to share with your school board, or district/school administrator


Dear Administrator, 

I’m writing to urge you to implement a district-wide change to allow computer science to count as a mathematics or science graduation requirement in our district, and communicate the change to all students. 

Computer science drives job growth and innovation throughout our economy and society. More than half of projected jobs in STEM fields are in computing occupations; computing occupations dominate “help wanted” ads; and computer science is one of the most in-demand degrees for new college graduates. However, computer science education is offered sparingly and underrepresented groups --especially girls and students of color-- report barriers to entry in the field and in accessing academic courses.   



According to Massachusetts State Statute, each local school districts has the authority to establish its own high school <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/graduation.html"_blank">graduation requirements</a>, to exceed the minimum expectations outlined in the state graduation guidelines. This policy does not require students to study computer science; it simply allows students who choose to take computer science courses to satisfy a requirement that already exists. Research shows that students are more likely to try computer science when it is part of the academic pathway rather than an elective. Also, teachers are more likely to seek certification in the computer science pathway or professional development opportunities when structured this way. 

Please consider making our district a leader in computer science education by allowing computer science courses to fulfil a district math or science graduation credit for students interested in this career pathway. Your efforts surrounding this matter will help prepare students for the 21st century workforce.  

Sincerely, 

Your name



## Frequently Asked Questions

Where can I find more information about adding computer science courses at my school? 

+ Resources, including curriculum and professional development opportunities, are available [here](/educate/districts). 
+ Additionally, learn more about Code.org’s district partnerships and how over 60 schools districts across the U.S. are expanding computer science education here. 
+ An inventory of computer science education resources and tools are also available [here](/educate/3rdparty). 
Share these resources with your K-5 partner schools and encourage elementary schools to expose students to computer science early! A number of videos and resources are available [here](/educate/inspire) to help get students started in or outside of the classroom.

What’s a good way to get kids excited about computer science?

+ Try the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com)! Or one of the [other tutorials](/learn/beyond) from Code.org and our many partners. Students have written over 5 billion lines of code, 1 billion of which was written in January 2015. Students of all ages love learning how to code and about computer science through fun and interactive curriculum.

How can our district get more girls and underrepresented students of color taking computer science?

+ Research shows that underrepresented students—especially girls—are more likely to take computer science if it counts as academic credit (in this case, mathematics or science).
+ The Hour of Code is a great way to de-mystify computer science. In 2014 alone, of the 60 million students who tried the Hour of Code nearly 48% were female (among all participants) and 36% were African American, Hispanic American, or Native American (among the US participants). 
Show students [videos](http://hourofcode.com/us/resources#videos) on the importance of computer science education from special messengers, such as Chris Bosh, Bill Gates, Susan Wojcicki, President Obama, among others! 


My school district does not currently count computer science as a graduation requirement. How can I help my district implement this policy?  

+ Use the above letter to send to your district superintendent or school board members. This letter is tailored to your state and outlines local discretion over setting graduation requirements. 
+ Communicate the importance of computer science education in developing critical thinking skills and preparing students for the 21st century workforce. The goal in allowing computer science to count towards a graduation requirement is not to require all students to take a computer science course. Rather, the goal is to increase access to computer science and to streamline the process for student pursuing this career pathway. 
+ Urge your school board to send a memo to all principals and guidance counselors clarifying that computer science will now count as a graduation requirement in accordance with local control authority. 
+ Request your school board to pass a proclamation to recognize the new graduation requirement. 
+ Share this letter and information with computer science students and parents and urge them to contact your school board.
