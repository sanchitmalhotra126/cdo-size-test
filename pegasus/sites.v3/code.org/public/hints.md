# Help us add smart hints to Code.org tutorials

We've had **millions** of students try the Code.org tutorials. They've submitted over **11 million** unique computer programs as solutions to roughly 100 puzzles. 

We've mapped out which submissions are errors (ie they don't solve the puzzle), and which are sub-optimal solutions (they solve the puzzle, but not efficiently).

Today, erroneous user submissions receive really unhelpful error feedback, such as "You're using the right blocks, but not in the right way". We want your help improving this, by providing **highly personal feedback** to very specific student errors. Watch the video below to see what we mean.

## Ready to help us?

If you're registered as a teacher on the Code.org tutorial platform, you can start adding hints for students.
