## 2018-19 Subsidy Program: Circuit Playground classroom kit  

<div class="col-60">
<p>
For teachers participating in the 2018-19 CS Discoveries Professional Learning Program and implementing the full-year version of the course, we're happy to announce that we will be subsidizing the cost of a single classroom kit for each teacher.
</p>

<p>
To receive a fully subsidized circuit playground, teachers must meet <b>all</b> of the following requirements:
</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Be a "qualified teacher" in the 2018-19 Code.org Professional Learning Program for CS Discoveries. Qualified teachers must have either: attended a 5-day summer workshop for CS Discoveries in 2018 as a participant, OR are participating in the 2018-19 Facilitator Development Program as a new CS Discoveries facilitator.</li>
		<li>Completed the first semester of the CS Discoveries curriculum with students. Qualified teachers must have at least one section of CS Discoveries on Code.org with at least 10 students who have made measurable progress in Units 2 <b>and</b> 3. (Note: content learned in Unit 3 is a prerequisite for Unit 6)</li>
		<li>Will teach Unit 6 by the end of the 2019-20 school year.</li>
	</ul>

If you meet **all** of the eligibility requirements, you will qualify for a subsidy based on the free and reduced price meal rates at your school (based on data from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/", target="_blank">National Center for Education Statistics</a>):

* **For teachers in schools with 40% or greater free/reduced price meals,** the classroom kit will be 100% subsidized, resulting in no cost to the teacher/school, including shipping.
* **For teachers at schools with less than 40% free/reduced price meals,** the classroom kit will not be subsidized. Teachers will be expected to pay for the full cost of the kit (approx. $350), though this price will be reduced by a 10% discount for educators to an approximate total of $315. To get the educator discount, teachers must apply the code ADAEDU at checkout.

If a teacher has a smaller class size and does not qualify for or need a full 15 board kit (which supports 30 students), they may purchase a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3795", target=_"blank">Code.org Circuit Playground Individual Kit</a>. The Individual Kit is designed for a single student or share-pair and costs $29.95.

**By the end of January 2019,** teachers will receive an email from us with more information about how to request a subsidy for the Adafruit Circuit Playground classroom kit on our website. In the meantime, qualified teachers should make sure they're on track in the 2018-19 school year to complete the first semester of CS Discoveries (Units 1-3) with their students.
