<img src="/images/marketing/afe-hs.jpg" style="width:45%; float:right; margin-left:25px; margin-bottom:25px">

Computer science is a foundational subject for a 21st century education. Students who study CS [perform better in other subjects, excel at problem solving, and are 17% more likely to attend college](https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536). By offering CS to your students, you’re helping create new opportunities for them!

Code.org has partnered with Amazon Future Engineer (AFE) to offer middle and high school teachers at underserved schools a growing number of resources and benefits at no cost!
