I, [Superintendent’s/Principal’s Name at High School/District,] [Title], give permission to the College Board to release the following school-level data to Microsoft Corporation (TEALS: Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) Program:

These data points are to be released exclusively to Microsoft Corporation for the purpose of providing its TEALS program (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) with information about AP performance by school to assess effectiveness of their program, teacher professional development, and intervention. I agree that the stated College Board data will not be released to Microsoft Corporation for any reason other than that stated in this letter.
