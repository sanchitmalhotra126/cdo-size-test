## What are the contest rules?
The rules are pretty easy. When submitting your project, you tag the special guest you'd like talk to on a video chat. BUT you can only tag one guest per entry. However, you can submit the same project multiple times tagging a different guest in each post. 

- Each entry must include the required tags and content to be considered and must be publicly visible.
- Feel free to enter as many projects and as many times as you want on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram!
