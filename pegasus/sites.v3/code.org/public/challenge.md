## What are the contest rules?
The rules are pretty easy. When submitting your project, you tag the celebrity you'd like talk to on a video chat. BUT you can only tag one celebrity per entry. Though that doesn't mean you can't submit the same project multiple times tagging a different celebrity in each post. 

Each entry must include the required tags and content for entry and must be publically visible.

Feel free to enter as many projects and as many times as you want on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram!
