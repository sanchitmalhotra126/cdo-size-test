# Join the Code.org #HourOfCode Challenge!

### Submit a creation made on Code.org and tag one of our special guests for a chance to win a 10-minute video chat with them!
**We'll be announcing the special guests soon...stay tuned!**

## How do I participate?
It's easy to get involved and win a classroom video chat with a special guest!

That's it! This challenge is open to classrooms, after-school clubs, and individual students.

## What are the contest rules?
When submitting your project, tag the special guest you'd like talk to on a video chat. BUT you can only tag one guest per entry. However, you can contact your favorite guest as many times as you want! 

Each entry must include the required tags and content to be considered and must be publicly visible.

## Is there any way to increase my chances of winning?
You may enter the contest simply by contacting your favorite guest, but your chances of winning will increase if you include these things in your post:

- a picture or video of you or your class during the Hour of Code;
- a link to an awesome Hour of Code creation made on Code.org;

 Check out this sample tweet for inspiration.

## How do you get the project link to share? 
When you finish one of our Hour of Code activities, on the last level you'll receive a share link. Use that link when you're communicating with one of our special guests.
