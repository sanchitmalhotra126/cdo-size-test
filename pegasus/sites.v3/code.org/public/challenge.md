# Join the Code.org #HourOfCode Challenge!

### Submit your classroom's best creation and tag a celebrity for a change to win a 10-minute video chat with them!
Our goal through Hour of Code has always been to encourage students to try computer science for the first time. 

## How do I participate?
It's easy to get involved and win a classroom video chat with a celebrity! 
Step one: do an hour of code! 

**If you haven't signed up to host an hour of code with your classroom yet, you can sign up here today.**

Step two: snap a few pictures of your class during the Hour of Code.
Step three: Tweet or publicly post the picture of your class on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.

What should I include with my social media post?

Great question! In addition to your class photo, your social media post should include:
- a link to an awesome Hour of Code creation made on Code.org
- the hashtag #HourOfCode
- the "handle" of the celebrity you want to contact

## What are the contest rules?
The rules are pretty easy. When submitting your project, you tag the celebrity you'd like talk to on a video chat. BUT you can only tag one celebrity per entry. Though that doesn't mean you can't submit the same project multiple times tagging a different celebrity in each post. 

Each entry must include the required tags and content for entry and must be publically visible.

Feel free to enter as many projects and as many times as you want on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram!

## Which celebrities are participating?
We're excited to announce that you'll have a chance to win a video chat with these awesome people.
