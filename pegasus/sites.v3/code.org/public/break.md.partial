<h1>Take a Code Break</h1>
With schools closed and tens of millions of students at home, Code.org is launching Code Break — a live weekly webcast where our team will teach your children at home while school is closed, and a weekly challenge to engage students of all abilities, even those without computers.

<h3>Let us teach your children:</h3>
* A weekly webcast, featuring our founder Hadi Partovi and special guests
* A weekly activity or challenge
* Options for beginners, experienced students, and even students without computers

<h2>Tired of studying? Take a Code Break!</h2>
<p>Computer science is <i>super fun</i> for kids, because it is creative and playful. Whether it’s solving a puzzle, coding art, or designing an app, computer science helps students learn by exploring rather than memorizing.</p>
<p>Computer science is <a href="https://code.org/promote">foundational</a> to all fields of study, but since many schools don’t offer it yet, this could be a unique chance to support your child in a fun new learning opportunity.</p>
<h2>Parents: Sign up to receive each week’s Code Break:</h2>
