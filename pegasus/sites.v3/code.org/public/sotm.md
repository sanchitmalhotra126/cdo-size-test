# Nominate a Student of the Month

## We want to recognize students who are changing the face of computer science.

What does a Code.org **Student of the Month** look like?

- A student who's learning in the face of adversity
- One who's building amazing things with computer science
- Or, one who's helping their peers learn, and is bringing computer science to others.

Every winning student will get a prize from Code.org and be featured online. See [past Code.org Students of the month](http://codeorg.tumblr.com/tagged/sotw).

### Please tell us about a rockstar student you know
Whether they're just learning the basics, or a coding whiz, all K-12 nominations are welcome. The world deserves to know about the amazing work they're doing!
