# Learning computer science when schools are closed
<div class="col-66" style="padding-right: 20px;">

<p>We are facing an incredibly challenging time with the global outbreak of Covid-19, grappling with growing concerns over health, our communities, and the economy. Safety measures have brought widespread school closures across the country. </p>
<p>We want to support teachers, students, and families in any way we can. Below is a set of resources to help your student learn computer science at home. </p>
<p>We are also working on resources to help teachers continue teaching computer science when their students are remote, and we will share them as soon as possible!</p>
