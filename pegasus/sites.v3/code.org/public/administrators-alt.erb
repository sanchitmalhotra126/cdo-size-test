<p>School and district administrators have a critical role in ensuring all students have access to computer science. At Code.org, we’ve worked with more than 180 districts, and understand the challenges administrators face are often unique to each district or school. That’s why we’ve partnered with more than 60 universities, nonprofits, and other organizations around the US to help districts and schools implement CS courses in a way that makes sense for them.</p>
<p>Your <a href="#getstarted">local Regional Partner</a> can help guide your school or district on implementation, certification, funding, and more.</p>

<h2>What is computer science and who is it for?</h2>
<h3>Computer science (CS) is much more than coding</h3>
<p>The Computer Science Teachers Association defines computer science as “the study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their implementation, and their impact on society.” Put simply, CS is about using technology to solve problems, make connections, or create art or games, often in collaborative and creative ways. Learning computer science, then, means learning skills essential to the workplace, like teamwork, problem-solving, creative and critical thinking, as well as content knowledge like programming.</p>

<h3>Computer science is for everyone</h3>
<p>Anyone can learn computer science, and because it’s so integral to our society, used in nearly every field or industry, it’s incredibly important that <strong><i>everyone</i></strong> has the opportunity to do so.</p>

<a id="whycs"></a>
<h2>Why computer science?</h2>

<h3 style="margin-top:0">Computer sciences makes students better thinkers and problem solvers</h3>
<p>Students who study computer science perform better in other subjects, excel at problem-solving, and are more likely to attend college, <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/cs-helps-students-outperform-in-school-college-and-workplace-66dd64a69536">according to recent research</a>.</p>

  <p>Studying computer science “prepares students for careers in government, law, the corporate sector, and graduate study,” <a href="https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofengineering/computerscience/">according to Stanford University</a>. Computing occupations are now the <a href="http://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/careers-in-computer-science-face-the-facts/">fastest-growing</a> segment of all professions, spanning all industries.

## Curriculum Options

### Code.org Programs
The Code.org curriculum is the most popular in K-12 computer science, with courses for every grade band. All the curriculum is offered at no cost to your school.

<%= view :course_explorer_table, responsive: true %>

[<button>View all Code.org programs</button>](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher)

<br>
### AP Computer Science A Resources
There are two AP computer science offerings, and students can take either course in any order. If your school does not yet offer AP Computer Science, we recommend starting with the new AP Computer Science Principles course. This course aims to broaden participation in computer science by introducing students to the foundational concepts and challenging them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world.

The AP Computer Sience A course and exam complement AP Computer Science Principles with a focus on computing skills related to programming in Java.

While Code.org does not have an AP Computer Science A curriculum, we have recommendations for a number of great curricula and programs available to teachers and students.

[<button>Learn more about AP CS A</button>](/educate/curriculum/apcsa)

<br>
### Third-party Programs
In addition to the Code.org curriculum, we’ve curated a list of recommended third party curriculum offerings with professional development programs.

## Help us track the momentum
Every day more schools and districts are pledging to bring computer science education to their students. Help us track progress of the movement by telling us about computer science education in your school or district.
