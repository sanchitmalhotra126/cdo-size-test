#  2020-21 Professional Learning opportunities for charter school teachers

## 6 studies show computer science helps students outperform
6 different studies show that students who study computer science in K-12 outperform in reading, writing, math, science, and problem-solving. They’re also much more likely to enroll in college.

## Charter schools can lead in innovation
Many high performing public charter schools have missions intently focused on educating students from traditionally underserved communities, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement, and college and career readiness. As the global economy grows ever more dependent on digital technologies, it is critical that these schools educate students in the fundamentals of science and technology. Computer science is now a foundational science for all 21st century careers, making access to this knowledge an equity issue the country must address.

## But charter schools are HALF as likely to offer computer science!
A recent review of data from Code.org shows that public charter high schools are *half* as likely to offer a computer science class compared to traditional public schools.  Given the diverse population that charter schools serve, including large populations of young women and underrepresented minority students, it is critical that public charter schools have the opportunity to provide access to quality computer science coursework for their students. 

Code.org is partnering with [KIPP](https://www.kipp.org/) and the [National Alliance of Public Charter Schools](https://www.publiccharters.org/) (NAPCS) to offer a special opportunity for teachers of grades 9-12 to learn to teach AP Computer Science Principles. The week-long virtual workshop and year-round collaboratives are free for accepted teachers thanks to a generous donation from [Reboot Representation](https://www.rebootrepresentation.org/about-the-coalition/), a tech coalition started by Melinda Gates that is committed to doubling the number of Black, Latina, and Native American women receiving computing degrees by 2025. 

Code.org also offers professional learning workshops for elementary and middle school teachers. See below for all the opportunities available to charter school teachers.

## For teachers of grades 9-12:

KIPP is offering a free, week-long virtual workshop on AP CS Principles on July 6-10 and monthly virtual collaboratives for support throughout the year, open to any public school. For more details about this opportunity, take a look at the memo KIPP put together, which includes the link to apply.
