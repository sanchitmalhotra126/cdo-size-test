## Join Russell Wilson, Ciara, and Jeff Bezos for a celebration of computer science

The CS Fest will bring together high school computer science students from Seattle area schools, to celebrate the young adults who are learning this important 21st century subject and to help them imagine their future in computer science.

Although our whole world runs on technology, most schools don't teach computer science, and most students don't take the class. Young women and students of color are especially missing an opportunity to participate as creators in our increasingly digital society.

If you're learning computer science in Seattle high schools, we can't wait to see you, April 2. If you're outside Seattle, please consider taking a class in coding or computer science, to learn this foundational subject.

If your school doesn't teach computer science, nominate a teacher for a scholarship to learn how, because every student in every school should have this opportunity.

**Puget Sound teachers:** even if your school doesn’t offer computer science, you can still attend! [Apply to the Code.org Progressional Learning program.](https://code.org/nominate) Middle school and high school teachers who participate in our 2020-21 Professional Learning program will all get to participate in this exclusive event!

### **More event details**
The celebration will be held on the morning of April 2. Location information will be shared directly with schools.  Student transportation to the event will be via school buses. Lunch will be provided.

Besides the “main event” featuring Russell Wilson, Ciara, Jeff Bezos, and Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi, the celebration will also feature a showcase of student creations, a “career fair” of local technology companies that offer job opportunities in computer science, and a “university fair” of local computer science learning opportunities for high school graduates.

### **How do I know if my school is participating?**
High school computer science classrooms from the Seattle, Highline, Federal Way, and Shoreline school districts are invited, as well as a handful of schools from the greater Puget Sound Area. See below for a list of all participating schools.

If you are a computer science teacher or administrator at one of these schools, contact us to confirm your school’s participation and schedule, bus, and logistical details.

If you’re a middle school or high school teacher in Puget Sound and your school doesn’t teach computer science, [apply to the Code.org Progressional Learning program](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning) to attend as an individual.

### **What if my school doesn’t teach computer science?**
If your school doesn't teach computer science, [nominate a teacher for a scholarship to learn how](https://code.org/nominate), because every student in every school should have this opportunity.
