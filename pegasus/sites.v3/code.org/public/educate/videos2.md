# Video Library

## Educational videos

As we recruit unique role models to record educational content, we are building a growing library of educational videos available for re-use by educators worldwide, online or in classrooms. While this library is a work-in-progress, our goal is to enable our efforts to be amplified beyond our own curriculum's reach. **Note:** see below for the licensing restrictions on use of these videos
