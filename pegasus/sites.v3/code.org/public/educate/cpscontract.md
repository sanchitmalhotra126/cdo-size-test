# Code.org's, Chicago Public Schools, and student data

In most of Code.org's agreements with school districts, the typical [language relating to student data](/educate/template-district-agreement) matches the philosophy of the [Code.org privacy policy](/privacy). In particular:

1. Any student achievement data provided by our school district partners will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating our work.
2. The data will be anonymous / de-identified, requested per the districtâ€™s standard process, consistent with all relevant laws governing such data.
3. Most importantly: Code.org will NOT receive any student achievement data from districts - we ask districts to deliver data to our third party evaluator who has been chosen for their track-record of evaluating education initiatives and data.

However, in the case of Chicago Public Schools, the contract between Code.org and Chicago Public Schools specifies a whole lot more than the above. Why? Because Chicago's legal team insisted on using the same pre-approved language used by CPS in all third-party relationships. The privacy language in the Code.org contract with Chicago describes a lot more data sharing than what Code.org will actually be doing, simply to avoid the legal costs and bureaucratic challenge of negotiating completely custom language. 

In practice, our relationship with Chicago Public Schools is **no different** when it comes to the privacy principles specified above, or in the Code.org privacy policy. And our contract with Chicago does not give Code.org access to any additional data, or with any different level of oversight, than our relationships with other school districts.
