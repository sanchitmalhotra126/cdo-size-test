## About the Curriculum

Powered by Bootstrap
<br/>
<br/>
Code.org has partnered with [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/) to develop a curriculum which teaches algebraic and geometric concepts through computer programming. 
<br/>
<br/>
The twenty lessons focus on concepts like order of operations, the Cartesian plane, function composition and definition, and solving word problems - all within the context of video game design. 
<br/>
<br/>
We believe that Code.org CS in Algebra breaths new life and exitement into traditonal pencil-and-paper problems by using an exciting, hands-on approach to apply algebra in the real world. 
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the course, students will have written programs to build composite images, animations, and a complete video game of their own design, all of which can be shared to demonstrate mastery of programming and algebra

#### <a name="components"></a>How does it work?

The Code.org CS in Algebra professional development program is designed to help teachers identify the intersection between Computer Science and Algebra in a way that supports student learning of Algebraic functions, with a focus on providing space for teachers to become comfortable with the curricular materials (lesson plans and computer-based tools) and associated teaching strategies.
