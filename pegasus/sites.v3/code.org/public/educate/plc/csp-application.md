# Computer Science Principles Application  

We're so excited that you are interested in applying for our Professional Learning Program for CS Principles. Space for the 2016-17 school year is limited, so be sure to get your application in soon.

Please note that this application is for teachers from districts that have partnerships with Code.org. If your district does not have a partnership, please add your information to our <a href="https://form.jotform.com/53365196731157" target=_blank>wait-list</a> and we'll let you know if space opens up. In the meantime, consider sending your administrators <a href="https://code.org/educate/districts" target=_blank>information about how to become a partner.</a>

[Review this PDF](/educate/plc/2016-17_CSP_Teacher_Application.pdf) of the application questions to ensure you have the information needed to complete the form. 

**Note about Principal Approval.** *This application requires your schoolâ€™s principal to provide their electronic signature. We recommend reviewing the application with your principal and completing the application together in the same room. NOTE: You cannot save and return to the application later.*
