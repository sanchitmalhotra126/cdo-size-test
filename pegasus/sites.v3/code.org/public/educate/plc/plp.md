# Professional Learning Partner Program #

## About the Program

Code.org is selecting organizations, as partners, to help teach Computer Science in a local, sustainable fashion. Our goal is for these local organizations to work with Code.org’s School District Partners to host professional learning workshops for teachers who are new to computer science, and to build and sustain a local community of computer science educators. 


We will provide the training, support, and initial funding to help each of these organizations establish themselves as the local partner of the Code.org professional learning community, with an expectation that each partner can find other sources of funding and sustain this work independently of Code.org in the long-run.

The ideal Professional Learning Partner is a regional education unit, a non-profit, a school district, or a university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community. Additionally, this partner must have experience managing and hosting professional development workshops.



## What we'd expect of you
Below is a list of program commitments:

- Provide a dedicated Professional Learning Partner Program Manager who will participate fully in the Program Manager onboarding & on-going program management responsibilities. (this is a ¼ FTE time commitment at first, but will grow with time)
- Attend our Facilitation Summit, May 20-22, 2016, and our 5-day Summer Professional Learning Experience with teachers from your state (dates vary)
- Organize and host quality, local workshops for Code.org’s district partners implementing Code.org’s high school and middle school programs, with Code.org-accredited facilitators
- Build, grow and sustain a local community of computer science educators (or join an existing community)
- Develop independent funding sources for the long-term sustainability of the work (with Code.org's cooperation)
