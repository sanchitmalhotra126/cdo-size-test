# Professional Learning Partner Program #

## About the Program

Code.org is establishing partnerships with local organizations to help replicate our work in a local, sustainable fashion. Our goal is for these local organizations to work with Code.org’s School District Partners to host professional learning workshops for teachers who are new to computer science, and to build and sustain a local community of computer science educators. We will provide the training, support, and initial funding to help each of these organizations establish themselves as the local partner of the Code.org professional learning community, with an expectation that each partner can find other sources of funding and sustain this work independently of Code.org in the long-run.

The ideal Professional Learning Partner is a regional education unit, a non-profit, a school district, or a university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community. Additionally, this partner must have experience managing and hosting professional development workshops.



## What does a Code.org Professional Learning Partner do?
If accepted into the Code.org Professional Learning Partner program, you will:

- Join a nationwide community of educators working to change the face of CS education 
- Plan and host in-person Computer Science professional development for local teachers with the help of approved facilitators
- Build a local community of Computer Science educators to share best practices, questions, thoughts, ideas and inspiration.
