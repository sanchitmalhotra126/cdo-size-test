# Professional Learning Partner Program #

## About the Program

Code.org is establishing partnerships with local organizations to help replicate our work in a local, sustainable fashion. Our goal is for these local organizations to work with Code.org’s School District Partners to host professional learning workshops for teachers who are new to computer science, and to build and sustain a local community of computer science educators. We will provide the training, support, and initial funding to help each of these organizations establish themselves as the local partner of the Code.org professional learning community, with an expectation that in the long-run each partner organization can sustain this work independently of Code.org.

The ideal Professional Learning Partner is a regional education unit, non-profit, school district, or university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community. In addition, this partner must have experience managing and hosting professional development workshops.



## What does a Code.org Professional Learning Partner do?
If accepted into the Code.org CSP Educator Development program, you will:

- Join a nationwide community of educators working to change the face of CS education 
- Participate in in-person and online professional development
- Plan and deliver the CSP curriculum to your students, and reflect on your experiences
