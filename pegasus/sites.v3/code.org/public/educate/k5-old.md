# Teach our K-5 program

## Curriculum
*[Now in beta](http://learn.code.org/beta)* - Code.org's three bands of computer science for the elementary school level:

- Course 1: for early-readers, ages 4-6
- Course 2: for beginners, ages 6+
- Course 3: for ages 6+

These course experiences blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with "unplugged" activities - lessons that teach computing concepts without a computer. Each level consists of about 20 lessons that may be implemented as one contiguous unit or one lesson a week for a semester. Each lesson may be implemented within a standard 30-45 minute period. 

The courses have been designed for students of all ages and they reinforce math, science, and english education standards for elementary school students.

## Free, 1-day professional development workshops near you
Elementary school teachers will have the opportunity to attend one-day workshops that will provide training and support for teaching our K-5 curriculum. They are open to both general classroom teachers and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed teachers, etc). 

These workshops will be run by Code.org's K-5 Affiliates nationwide. Approximately 100 affiliates will attend a summit this summer to prepare for local workshops as part of a 2014-2015 pilot program. 

## Sign up
**Teachers, principals, and parents:** Sign up to be notified when a list of local workshops is available *(US only)*. In August, you will be able to search and sign up for specific workshops in your area.
