## K-12 2018-19 Supplies Plan

Code.org will be covering the cost of all initial supplies needed for all K-12 programs. We will do this by shipping materials directly, providing a lump sum for partners to purchase supplies, or by covering the cost of items ordered through the Mimeo Marketplace. The [2018-19 K-12 Supplies Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L5EdftQmtZls57P5OtwmNGl6wPKrb8VbFE6xP0vdWZY/edit#heading=h.80sk5rtogqp6) outlines the details, including key differences in how supplies will be handled in the K-5 program and the 6-12 program.

## Ordering 2017-18 Academic Year Supplies
Academic year supplies should be shipped/ordered by Program Managers as follows *(Remember: all supply orders must be placed 21 days prior to your workshop)*:

Regional Managers were asked to order 1 Workshops Supplies Kit for each course cohort (either CS Principles or CS Discoveries) in the fall of 2017 through the [Mimeo Marketplace](https://marketplace.mimeo.com/codeorgworkshop).

These workshop kits are designed to provide you with enough supplies to last the full academic year, including 6 easel pads.

*Note: The only course with swag is Administrator & Counselor PD.*

CS Principles and CS Discoveries have printed material for Quarter Three and Four workshops. These can be ordered in the [Mimeo Marketplace](https://marketplace.mimeo.com/codeorgworkshop). Please order at least four weeks before your scheduled workshop.

You can also print these materials directly yourself:

**CS Discoveries Quarter 3 Printed Materials** Printed materials needed can be found  [here](https://curriculum.code.org/plcsd/q3/). (Scroll down to “Printing” in the “Before the Workshop section.”). If you are using the Semester Implementation Agenda, you will need one less printed item. Please view the list of materials needed [here](https://curriculum.code.org/plcsd/q3-semester/).

**CS Principles Quarter 3 Printed Materials:** Printed materials needed can be found [here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/2018-explore-performance-tasks-sg.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles).

**CS Principles Quarter 4 Printed Materials:** Printed materials needed can be found [here](https://curriculum.code.org/plcsp/q4/). (Scroll down to "Supplies" section.)

## Ordering 2017-18 Administrator & Counselor PD Supplies
Order Administrator & Counselor Supplies from the [Mimeo Marketplace](https://marketplace.mimeo.com/codeorgworkshop)

You may order 1 swag bag per attendee and 1 of each of the documents shown in the "Attendee Materials" section (unless otherwise noted -- some are 1 per PAIR of attendees), plus 1 applicable State Fact Sheet(s), per attendee.

Guidelines to keep in mind:
- Orders need to be placed no later than 21 calendar days before the workshop to ensure timely arrival. No rush shipping will be accommodated.
- Please provide a link to the workshops that you are ordering for in the 'Workshop Link' field on the payment page. Orders without a link will be declined.  
- Orders with printed material of $100 or more qualifies for free shipping of the full order. Please ensure that if you need swag bags, you are ordering them with printed materials.
- All orders will go through an approval process.

If you have reached your limit of Administrator and Counselor swag bags and documents (80 sets), you will need to place a separate order for additional materials here:  https://marketplace.mimeo.com/codeorgworkshopextras

*Please note: You will be responsible for the cost of the items and shipping in the 'Extra Supplies' marketplace.
