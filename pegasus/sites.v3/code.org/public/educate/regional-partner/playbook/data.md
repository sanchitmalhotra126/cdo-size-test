## K-12 Computer Science Access Report
The CSTA and Code.org are partnering to create the first-ever comprehensive report of which schools offer computer science in the US. We are using a combination of crowdsourced surveys, data from curriculum providers like the College Board and data from state departments of education to get information about every school in the country. All the data we are gathering is made public on our site at <a href="http://code.org/yourschool" target=_blank>http://code.org/yourschool</a> and as regional partners, you have access to even more data via Tableau. Learn about how to access this data in the [Data Dashboard How-To Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KgWKsfRuzC740lDZLlgjTpW4qZ-Wnt0U-v1xpNHjss/edit?ts=5a737737#)

The data we gather can be an incredible resource to you, but only if it is robust. We need your help gathering data about every school in the country!
