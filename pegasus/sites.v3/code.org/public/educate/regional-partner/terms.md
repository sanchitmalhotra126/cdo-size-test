## Joint Commitment
- We will cooperate together so that your work is fully funded by means other than Code.org  before the start of Year 4 (2021-2022) of the partnership, or before as determined by annual funding conversations. 
	- The vision is long-term funding will come from federal, state or local sources. We expect you will lead the fundraising in your local area. We can provide guidance, introductions, sample grant applications, etc. as needed, and establish you as a Code.org-accredited provider. In some regions, we may also be able to connect you to local funders.
- We will collaborate to establish your organization as a certified Regional Provider of computer science Professional Learning, so teachers from local districts can receive formal credit from participating in workshops.
- We will cooperate to identify, recruit, build and maintain local facilitator capacity. Facilitators need to meet Code.org’s established selection criteria.
- We will collaborate (within the legal constraints of the respective organizations) on K-12 computer science policy-related matters that our respective organizations are working on in the state.  

<br/>
We view this as a long-term partnership. We see your organization joining a network of organizations supporting a nationwide movement to build local computer science hubs. We hope to find many ways beyond the scope of this document to cooperate in spreading computer science in K-12 schools.
