# School Districts & Code.org
Our historical partner school districts teach almost **10%** of all U.S. students, and almost **15%** of the nation's Hispanic and African American students. Starting in 2018, school districts all around the country have pledged to expand Computer Science education in their schools.  

Learn how our regional partners [help expand computer science offerings in your school or district](/administrators). Or, you can get started yourself to help bring computer science to your school or district. [Sign the pledge and learn more here](/yourschool).
