# Educator resources

## Start with an Hour of Code for your students
The Hour of Code is an opportunity for every student to try computer science for one hour. You can also teach the Hour of Code all year-round. Tutorials work on browsers, tablets, smartphones, or "unplugged."

## Bring computer science to your elementary school this fall
Sign up to be notified about Code.org workshops coming this fall. Workshops will provide training and support for teaching [Code.org's new K-5 curriculum](educate/curriculum), with distinct courses for K-1, 2-3 and 4-5.

## Teach our short intro course in any classroom or club (self-serve)
Code.org's K-8 Intro to Computer Science course is a 20-hour series of tutorials and activities, designed for any educator to host in a classroom, after-school, or even in a club outside of school. 

In partnership with [Donorschoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org/)  we are offering up to $1,000 in rewards to the first 1,000 teachers to successfully establish this course in U.S. public school classrooms.
