Whether you're a school teacher, an administrator, an after-school teacher, or a volunteer, Code.org provides educational resources for all ages, free of cost. Below is a summary of our curriculum and other programs. Our online courses on [Code Studio](http://studio.code.org) are meant for use in all settings &mdash; in-school, home-schooling, after-school &mdash; and can be taught by teachers, parents or volunteers. 

<!-- If you're a parent, you can guide your child to [learn online](/learn/beyond) or [at a local workshop or camp](/learn/local), or [help us in other ways](/help).  -->

# The Hour of Code
The first step to introduce children to computer science is to participate in the Hour of Code, the largest learning campaign in history. In one hour, students (and teachers) can learn that computer science is fun, easy, and accessible at all ages.

# Philosophy
If you like to geek out on education philosophy, we've published our [curriculum philosophy](/educate/curriculum-philosophy) and [professional development philosophy](/educate/professional-development-philosophy). We use these documents to inspire our own team's work and to help guide our work with our curriculum partners.
