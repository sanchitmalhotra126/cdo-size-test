# Educator resources

## Start with an Hour of Code
More than 44 million people of all ages have learned an [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com), a one-hour introductory course designed to demystify computer science and show that anybody can learn the basics. Participate this December 8-14 during Computer Science Education Week and help reach 100 million students by the end of 2014.

## Teach one of our online courses 
Code.org's online platform [Code Studio](studio.code.org) enables students to learn the basic concepts of computer science as early as kindergarten. Within Code Studio, a new Play Lab has been developed where elementary students can create and send apps or animations directly to a cell phone, just by typing in the phone number. Or try our general course designed for any educator to host in a classroom, after-school program, or even in a club outside of school.

**Professional development workshops- at no cost (US teachers only):**  Code.org is offering amazing, zero-cost, 1-day workshops to prepare educators and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed specialists, etc.) to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun and accessible to the youngest learners (grades K-5).  The workshop will cover content for all three courses and teachers will receive the supplies they need to teach the course- at no cost.

These workshops will be led by experienced Code.org K-5 Facilitators in over 60 cities across the United States.

## K-12 computer science curriculum

We aim to provide curriculum resources for a full K-12 pathway in computer science. This is a work in progress, in collaboration with educators throughout the computer science community. All of our curriculum resources will be publicly available under a [Creative Commons License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

## Inspire students (especially women) to try computer science

Here's a collection of videos, posters, and how-to resources to help inspire students to try computer science. Also, use our [educational video library](/educate/videos) and [nominate a student](/sotw) or [teacher](/totm) you know for a Code.org award.
