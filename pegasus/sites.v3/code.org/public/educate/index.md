# Educator resources

## Start with an Hour of Code for your students
The Hour of Code is an opportunity for every student to try computer science for one hour. You can also teach the Hour of Code all year-round. Tutorials work on browsers, tablets, smartphones, or "unplugged."

## Bring computer science to your elementary school
Code.org has developed a free elementary school curriculum that allows even the youngest students to explore the limitless world of computing. There are three levels of computer science at the elementary school level.

**Free professional development workshops (US teachers only):**  Code.org is offering free workshops for K-5 educators and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed specialists, etc.) interested in teaching the Code.org elementary school computer science curriculum. The
workshop will cover content for all three courses and teachers will receive the supplies they need to teach the course- at no cost.

These workshops will be led by experienced Code.org K-5 Facilitators in over 60 cities across the United States.
