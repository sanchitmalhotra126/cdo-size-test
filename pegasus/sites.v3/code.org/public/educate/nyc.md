# Teach Computer Science at Your School

## Why Computer Science?

Computer science opens more doors for students than any other discipline in today’s world. Learning even the basics will help students lead in virtually any career -- from architecture to zoology.  Just as we teach students multiplication and division, or how electricity works, it’s important for every 21st century student to have a chance to “dissect an app,” or learn how the Internet works.

## NYC Teachers and administrators:

### Grades K-5
Code.org has developed an elementary school curriculum that allows even the youngest students to explore the limitless world of computing - at no cost for schools. The courses blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with “unplugged” activities that require no computer at all. Each course consists of about 20 lessons that may be implemented as one unit or over the course of a semester. Even kindergarten-aged pre-readers can participate.

### Middle School
Code.org has partnered with the award-winning Project GUTS (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to deliver a middle school science program consisting of four instructional modules and professional development for the introduction of computer science concepts into science classrooms within the context of modeling and simulation. For more information on the curriculum visit [Code.org/curriculum/mss.](Code.org/curriculum/mss)  There is no cost for schools to apply, and teachers receive per-session funding for professional development! *This program is open to all NYC DOE middle schools*
