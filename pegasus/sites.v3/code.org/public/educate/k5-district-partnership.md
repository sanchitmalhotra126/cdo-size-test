# Partner with Code.org to bring K-5 computer science to your district

Code.org has developed an online Computer Science curriculum for elementary echool students. The curriculum comprises Code Studio Courses 1, 2 and 3, which are free and publicly available at [studio.code.org](studio.code.org). Our goal is to spread this curricula to tens of thousands of classrooms across the US through the development and implementation of K-5 district partnerships. 

## Code.org's commitment (at no cost to the district):

If your application is accepted, Code.org would cover all costs of training your selected Facilitator in the Code.org curriculum, and would provide the Code.org curriculum including printed curriculum guide, classroom supplies to all participating district teaching staff.

## District's commitment:

On the district's side, partnership would entail identifying a member of the district staff who would be the district Facilitator responsible for hosting Code Studio professional development workshops within the district, to prepare teachers to offer the Code Studio curriculum broadly within grades K-5.  Beyond the costs covered by Code.org (curriculum, Facilitator support, and classroom supplies), the district would be responsible for the other costs of incorporating the curriculum into the existing district professional development schedule.
