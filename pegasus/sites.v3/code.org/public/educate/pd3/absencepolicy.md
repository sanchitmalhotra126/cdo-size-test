# Code.org Policy on Teacher Attendance #

Districts are required to select teachers who will be teaching the course in the fall, that are able to attend all days of professional development (for high school there are four phases over 15 months, for middle school there are three phases over 12 months), and teachers must commit to attending all days of professional development (PD) when joining a Code.org cohort.

1. Teachers will only receive stipends for the hours that they **attend** the professional development.
2. Arriving/leaving over 30 minutes late/early will count as a full day absence if not approved by Code.org **prior** to the workshop.
3. Teacher must complete phase 1 PD prior to the start of phase 2 PD to continue to be part of the program and will not receive his/her phase 2 PD stipend until phase 1 PD is completed.
4. Teacher must attend the full [5 days High School/3 days Middle School Science/2 days Middle School Math] of phase 2 PD to continue to be part of the program.
5. Teacher must be teaching computer science to a minimum of 1 section of students when the school year begins to continue to be part of the program.
