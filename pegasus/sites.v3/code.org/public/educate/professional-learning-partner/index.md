# Professional Learning Partner Program #

## About the Program

Code.org is selecting organizations, as partners, to help teach computer science in a local, sustainable fashion. The goal of the Professional Learning Partner program is to help each organization establish itself as a local partner of the Code.org professional learning community, with an expectation that in the long-run each partner organization can sustain this work independently of Code.org.

Each partner's program manager will attend our Program Manager Summit, a fabulous experience designed to welcome Professional Learning Partners to the extended Code.org family. In addition, we will provide funding based on demonstrated need to help each organization establish itself as a local Code.org professional learning partner.

The ideal Professional Learning Partner is a regional education unit, a non-profit, or a university with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community.

## What we'd expect of you
Below is a list of program commitments:

- Provide a dedicated Professional Learning Partner Program Manager who will participate fully in the Program Manager onboarding & on-going program management responsibilities. (up to 0.5 of an FTE’s time - this can be shared across one or more staff members of your organization)
- Attend our Facilitation Summit and our 5-day Code.org TeacherCon with teachers from your state. 
- Organize and host quality, local workshops for Code.org’s district partners implementing Code.org’s high school and middle school programs, with Code.org-accredited facilitators
- Build, grow and sustain a local community of computer science educators (or join an existing community)
- Develop independent funding sources for the long-term sustainability of the work (with Code.org's cooperation)

 
## What Code.org will provide in return
- Provide funding based on demonstrated need to cover the following: an onsite staffer, facilitator compensation, food, and venue for your work in the initial year(s)
- Marketing your organization as the official Code.org Professional Learning Partner for your region
