# Workshop Planning

The PLP will provide proposed dates to Code.org for each phase of MS/HS professional development. Code.org will negotiaite and finalize the dates for each workshop, and add then to the Facilitator Master Schedule.

Once the dates are confirmed, the PLP will be responsible for planning the Counselor/Administrator PD and the Academic year development workshops and is responsible for securing venues, ordering supplies and providing catering for each workshop.

**Securing a Venue**<br/>
These guidelines will give your facilitators the space they need to run a successful workshop, as well as remind you of important factors to consider for logistics and teacher experience. <br/>

| |Requirements and Suggestions| 
|:-----|:-----------|
|**Location**|**Consideration of these factors will help you find the ideal location for your workshop.**<br/><br/> - Central location: Is the location central to the spread of teachers attending?<br/> <br/>- Catering: Are there several options to order from within 20 miles? Is there an internal or preferred caterer for the venue?<br/><br/> - Parking: Does it cost anything? Will teachers need parking passes? Is the lot close to an entrance?<br/><br/> - Access: Will there be someone from the venue there to open the building, help with getting supplies to your room(s), and be available to help with technology as needed during the workshop?| 
|**Rooms and <br/>Set Up**| Reservation time: <br/>Rooms need to be reserved from 7:30am to 4:30pm.<Br/><br/> General itinerary breakdown:<br/> 7:30 am - 8:00 am - facilitators arrive and set up room<br/>8:00 am - 8:30 am - teachers arrive, register & eat breakfast</br> 8:30 am - 12:00 pm - workshop time<br/> 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm - break for lunch<br/>1:00 pm - 4:00 pm - workshop time<br/>4:00 pm - 4:30 pm - facilitators clean up for the night <br/><br/>Rooms Needed:<br/>- One room for entire group<br/>- Breakout room to set up catering and for eating. Hallway space also works. We recommend doing this to avoid interrupting the session by setting up food in the room.<br/>- Wall space for hanging poster sized paper with Blue painter's tape<br/> - Space to store supplies overnight: We recommend asking your venue if supplies and posters can be left in the room and locked up overnight to avoid having to pack everything out each day of the workshop.<br/><br/>Table set up and Seating:<br/>- Classroom style seating with tables that can seat pairs.| 
|**Technology <br/>Requirements**| - Projector and Screen<br/><br/> - Power outlets and Extention cords<br/><br/> - Wifi that can support access by all participants<br/> |
|**Logistical Information**|- Physical Address of Workshop<br/><br/>- Address to ship supplies (If needed)<br/><Br/> - Map of the Campus and/or building to help teachers find the room. Driving instructions should be provded to teachers. This can be done via Google Maps.<br/><br/> - Wifi strength and password. All participants will need to be on the network at the same time with no lag.<br/><br/> - Arrangments for Access: You should make arrangements with your venue contact to give you access to the building and help you locate supplies.| 
|**Information for Facilitator One Pager**| - Workshop address including room number<br/><br/> - Times the room is available as listed above in the reservation requirements<br/><br/> - Room set up: This should be standard as listed above in the seating requirements<br/><br/> - Parking details as mentioned above<br/><br/> - Wifi login information as listed above<br/><br/> - Venue Contact Informaton as listed above<br/><br/> - Any other venue specific information about access, security, etc.<br/>|

**Catering** <br/>
For multi-day events like summer workshops, we provide a heartier breakfast to get them through the day, ideally breakfast sandwiches or a hot buffet, with juice/coffee service. We also provide lunch that should vary from day to day.<br/>

We always accommodate vegetarian needs, roughly ⅓ of the order. In our communications to teachers and workshop attendees we ask that if they have special dietary restrictions that they plan accordingly. It’s very difficult to plan for every need, and is often more expensive.<br/><br/>
