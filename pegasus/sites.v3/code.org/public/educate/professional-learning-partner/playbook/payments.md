## Teacher Workshops
Code.org pays PLPs for program expenses related to hosting workshops for teachers according to their contracts. These payments may include funds for facilitators at the workshops, costs for venue space and food during the workshop day, and compensation for time for a PLP staff member to plan and execute the workshop. 

Code.orgâ€™s payment cycles are the 1st-15th and 16th-last day of each month. In the two weeks following, Code.org prepares a report and sends it with payment for all workshops closed in that prior period. For example: if a workshop was held July 11-12th, the cycle would close July 15th, and Code.org would mail a check to the PLP by the end of July.

## Facilitators
**ECS, CS in Science, and CS in Algebra Facilitator Payments**

- All facilitators (veteran and facilitators in training) are paid $500 per workshop day. There is no urban multiplier applied to this amount as it is considered a pass through expense.
- In Summer 2016, Code.org directly paid any non-local veteran faciiltators as they were only working at your site during the summer.
- Starting with the first Academic Year Workshop, each PLP is responsible for contracting with and paying all facilitators. We will include the funding for you to pay them in our checks to your organization.

**CS Principles Facilitator Payments**

- All facilitators are paid $500 per workshop day. There is no urban multiplier applied to this amount as it is considered a pass through expense.
