# Facilitator Support


Facilitators will be trained and/or provided by Code.org for each middle and high school workshop. The Professional Leraning Partner will contract and manage communication regarding workshop logistics with the facilitators.  

The Program Managers and Facilitators will be introduced upon recruitment and connect at Facilitatotion Summit, as well as Code.org TeacherCon to learn the best methods of providing a valuable workshop experience to the local teachers. 

The PLP will contract with Code.org provided facilitators at $50 an hour, which is the standard Code.org rate, and cover travel expenses for facilitators for each phase of Middle and High School professional learning program.
