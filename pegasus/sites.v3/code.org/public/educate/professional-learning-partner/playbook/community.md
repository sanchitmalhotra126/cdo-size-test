# Community Building

As a Code.org Partner, you’ve agreed to: 

- Be the regional hub of a nationwide CS education movement
- Organize at least 4 community meetups
- Host a computer science fair in Year 2 of the partnership

**What’s the goal?**<br/>
Teachers should feel supported as members of a teacher community. Use community events to foster that sense of support and community! 

**Who’s included?**<br/>
Incorporate the diverse and varied computer science community in your events! Anyone who is interested in supporting computer science in the classroom should feel like they can attend.
