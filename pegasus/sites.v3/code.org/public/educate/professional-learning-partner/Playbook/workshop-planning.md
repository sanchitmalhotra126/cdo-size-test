# Workshop Planning

The PLP will provide proposed dates to Code.org for each phase of MS/HS professional development. Code.org will negotiaite and finalize the dates for each workshop, and add then to the Facilitator Master Schedule.

Once the dates are confirmed, the PLP will be responsible for planning the Counselor/Administrator PD and the Academic year development workshops and is responsible for securing venues, ordering supplies and providing catering for each workshop.
