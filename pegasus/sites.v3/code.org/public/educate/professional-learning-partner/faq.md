### **My city isn't on the map, can I stil apply to be a Professional Learning Partner?**

For this year, we are only looking for professional learning partners in the cities where Code.org has a district partnership and has teachers enrolled in the Code.org Computer Science Principles Professional Learning Program. If you are interested in becoming a Professional Learning Partner for the 2017-18 school year and are willing to help recruit school districts in your area, please email partner@code.org and we will connect you with the District Outreach Manager for your state.

### **If we are selected as the Code.org professional learning partner in our region, can we publish a press release?**

Of course! Anyone accepted to be a partner can publish a press release. We ask that your organization take the lead on the content and that Code.org is provided the opportunity to review it prior to print.

### **Does my organization need to provide facilitators for CS Principles?**

Your organization does not need to have its own facilitators. Code.org Professional Learning Partners can  opt to contract with local Code.org approved facilitators instead.

### **Can I recruit teachers from local districts to become a part of the 2016-17 CS Principles professional learning program?**

Our general rule: a teacher must be from a district that Code.org has a district partnership with to apply for the CS Principles professional learning program. However, you are welcome to encourage local teachers who have a spot on their master schedule to teach AP Computer Science Principles in the Fall to join our program's wait list.

### **I don't see any funding in the budget to run Exploring CS, CS in Science or CS in Algebra. What does Code.org provide for these programs?**

The professional learning partner program is designed around CS Principles and CS Discoveries. If your organization is selected to offer Exploring CS, CS in Science and CS in Algebra to teachers in their region, we will discuss additional funding options separately.

### **How do I know if my organization is located in an urban area?**

Code.org uses the United States Census Bureau's metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas to determine whether or not a partner is located in an urban area. The Census Bureau defines a metro area as "a core urban area of 50,000 or more in population". <a href="http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/metroarea/us_wall/Feb2013/cbsa_us_0213_large.gif" target=_blank>View this map</a> to determine if your organization is in an urban area.
