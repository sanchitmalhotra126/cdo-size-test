# Organizing your workshop
## What you need
- A venue with compatible technology and setup
- Materials to teach the curriculum
- Lunch/snack for participants (at your discretion)
- Code.org swag bags for participating teachers
- Teaching assistants or volunteers (at your discretion)

## Where to start
**1. Find a venue.** We suggest reaching out to local schools, universities, companies, libraries, science museums, chambers of commerce, or other community groups to obtain a space to host your workshop. Consult our [sample emails](#emails) for help reaching out to these groups. If you aren't sure where to start, visit the list of [Code.org donors](/about/donors) and [Code.org partners](/about/partners) to see if any of these organizations have offices near you. If they do, we may be able to facilitate an introduction to request space for a weekend workshop. Make sure you have WiFi.

**2. Set dates and times.** Arrange when your workshop will start and what days and times it will run. Agree to a limit of participants per workshop. We recommend no more than 20 attendees per trainer. 

**3. Post your workshop to Code.org.** To publicize and recruit teachers to workshops you are hosting you can post them to the Code.org website on the Code.org K-5 Teacher Sign Up page. This page allows anyone visiting Code.org to find a K-5 workshop being hosted in their area and sign up. For more information about how to post your workshop to the Code.org website see the “[Posting Your Workshop to Code.org](#post)” section of this page.

**4. Promote the workshop.** There are a number of ways to reach out to teachers to attend your workshop. Check out the section on [Teacher Recruitment Strategies](#recruit) for help.

## How to prepare for each workshop
**1. Send a confirmation email.** Two weeks before your workshop you may want to follow-up with teachers signed up to confirm their attendance. This is a great time to get a head count and collect any dietary information you may need to know. If you find out a teacher can no longer attend, reach out to other teachers you may have turned away. Consult our [sample emails](#emails) for help.

**2. Send a reminder email.** A week before your workshop, send teachers attending your workshop an email reminding them they signed up. Make sure to include important information such as time, location, directions to venue, workshop agenda, etc. Consult our [sample emails](#emails) for help. 

**3. Make your curriculum guide, swag bag, and workshop materials request.** Do this two weeks before your workshop to ensure the appropriate number of swag bags arrive on time. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/forms/d/1JcqSp7citj3As9l6X7IGEEJbfK3iVVE_uS1iLBPZ1Jk/viewform) to request these items.

**4. Arrange food/snacks.** Part of the per-teacher stipend should be allocated to provide attending teachers with lunch or snacks. Your food plan is up to you, and depends on the workshop start/end time. Affiliates are encouraged, but not required to provide individual meals. We recommend that affiliates provide light snacks/beverages at their workshops, and allow a lunch break for teachers to go to a nearby restaurant or cafeteria. 

**5. Recruit teaching assistants or volunteers.** While this isn’t required it may be helpful. If you want to host workshops with more than 15-20 teachers, we strongly recommend recruiting a TA to help out. This could be a fellow teacher or a college-aged student.  It is up to you whether you want to pay the TA or not out of your existing per-teacher Affiliate stipend.

# Posting Your Workshop to Code.org
To help publicize and recruit teachers to workshops you are hosting as well as expedite payment, we ask that you post all workshops to Code.org on the Code.org K-5 Teacher Sign Up page. This section outlines the process for posting your workshop to the Code.org website.

- You will post your workshops through the “Affiliate Dashboard” using your Code.org account.
- Upon Posting the workshop, a "section" is created.
- You will be able to choose whether to make the workshop "public" or "private". This feature allows you to host a workshop for a specific group.
	 - **Public** goes to "Search for a workshop near you" page and allows anyone to sign up.
	 - **Private** does not. You will need to share the URL with the group you are hosting the workshop for them to sign up.
- Upon sign up, a confirmation email is sent to both you and the teacher.


<a id="manage"></a>
# Tracking Your Workshop Attendance 
This section outlines the process for tracking your workshop attendance and receiving your per teacher stipend. 

1. At the beginning of the workshop, sign into your Affiliate Dashboard. Go to the workshop section you are hosting and click "open".
- This is when the section is created and generates a URL.
- Ask workshop attendees to sign into their Code.org account and join your "section" using this URL.
- During the course of the workshop teachers are predicted to complete a minimum of 10 of the puzzles. 
- **At the end of the workshop day, you *MUST* “close” the workshop section.** This takes a snapshot of the teachers’ progress and sends a report to Code.org notifying us that you have completed your workshop. We will calculate stipend payment based on puzzle completion. To receive credit for a teacher attending your workshop he/she should complete a minimum of 10 puzzles throughout the workshop.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: While we are basing payment on puzzle completion is NOT the actual key part of a successful PD**. It's just the easiest way for us to quickly measure participation and expedite affiliate payment.

**SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE: We cannot express how important this final step is to ensuring you receive credit for hosting the workshop.** If you fail to complete this step, Code.org will unfortunately not be able to provide you with a stipend for teachers trained.

## Email to recruit principals
**Subject Line:** Bring computer science to your K-5 classrooms!

Dear [Name], 

**Prepare elementary school students for the 21st century**
Software is redefining the modern world and is increasingly relevant in every 21st century career. Yet fewer than 10% of US public schools teach computer science, and the number has declined in the past decade. Women and students of color are severely underrepresented in this foundational field. One of the ways to solve this problem is to introduce computer science at a younger age. We're making this easy for any elementary school teacher to incorporate into their classroom.

Starting this fall, we are hosting free, one-day workshops for educators interested in teaching the Code.org computer science course for grades K-5. Encourage teachers to sign up for a free weekend workshop and to bring computer science program to your school!

**What is the Code.org K-5 program? Easy, engaging, and fun**

Code.org has three bands of computer science for the elementary school level:

- Course 1: for early-readers, ages 4-6
- Course 2: for beginners, ages 6+
- Course 3: for ages 6+

These courses experiences blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with "unplugged" activities - lessons that teach computing concepts without a computer. Each level consists of about 20 lessons that may be implemented as one contiguous unit or one lesson a week for a semester. Each lesson may be implemented within a standard 45-50 minute class period.

The courses have been designed for students of all ages, but they reinforce math, science, and english education standards for elementary school students.

**Why bring computer science to your school?**

Computer science is a foundational subject for all 21st century careers. All students can benefit from studying the basics of computer science, regardless of whether they want to be a doctor, politician, entrepreneur, musician, or astronaut. 

***Tell your teachers to [sign up](http://code.org/k5) now so they can start teaching these life-changing skills!***

# Teacher Recruitment Strategies
## What Code.org is doing: 

- **Launch date!** on September 15th, Code.org will send out an email blast to our mailing list of ~50,000 teachers directing them to the workshop sign up page.
- Marketing video for you to send in emails, and show at meetings and other speaking engagements.
- One-pager (coming soon) that overviews the K-5 curriculum to share in emails, meetings, and other speaking engagements.
- Listing all affiliate workshops on the Code.org website for easy teacher sign-up.
- Producing a marketing flyer you can modify to promote your workshop date, time and location (coming soon).
- Access to the [In Partnership with Code.org logo](/files/partner-logo.zip) logo to validate your efforts.
- Targeted outreach through our numerous partners and their networks. See list [here](http://code.org/partners). 

## What you can do:

**Post a few workshop dates before our launch date to capitalize on the traffic we will be sending to the signup page.**

### Work top down. 
Recruit individuals or organizations that reach large networks of teachers to spread your message. Examples include: superintendents, school board members, district leaders, school leaders, local politicians, local teacher union chapters, and other local teacher-facing organizations. Use our sample emails to schedule meetings with these individuals and organizations. Consult school districts’ websites to find contact information for district leaders. A quick internet search should bring you to their homepage. 

An ideal model is to work with your local school district to host workshops on teacher in-service days. If they aren’t able to accommodate this, they may be able to send out information regarding your workshop through a teacher or principal listserv or post on their website on a resource page. 

### Work bottom up.
Word of mouth is a powerful (and free) marketing scheme. Happy customers are your best way to grow demand. Ask teachers who attend your workshop to help spread the word through their social networks. 

### Tips for pitching your workshop:

**Ahead of time...** 

- **Schedule a call or in-person meeting.** Use our [sample email](#emails) to save time.
- **Attach the K5 one-pager.** This will provide them a short overview of the curriculum as well as serve as a reference for them to share internally. 
- **Link to the promo video.** This is the easiest and fastest way for people to understand the K-5 program..

**During the call/meeting...**

- **Introduce yourself.** Open up by explaining who you are and your affiliation with Code.org. 
Example: My name is Laura Kline. The past five years, I have worked as an elementary school teacher at Walker Elementary. I have hosted numerous workshops for teachers throughout the district and have a big passion for growing computer science education. More recently, I have teamed up with Code.org, a national non-profit working to grow computer science education, to run free, one-day workshops for elementary school teachers in my area interested in teaching computer science. 
- **Play the promo video (if appropriate).** It’s short and a great introduction. And they likely didn’t watch it when you sent it with the email. 
- **Deliver the elevator pitch.**
- **Hit some (or all) of these talking points:**
- The training and the curriculum are FREE for anyone, anywhere to use.
- Computational thinking is crucial for problem solving of all types.  It teaches a student how to break down problems into chunks that are easier to manage, and encourages them to persevere through several failed attempts, giving them the fortitude to persist until they find something that works. These techniques are helpful throughout life, no matter what students are interested in.
- The curriculum aligns and integrates national standards. We align to standards from the CSTA and ISTE, and practices from the NGSS and Math Common Core. We integrate Common Core Math and ELA standards wherever appropriate, which allows students to reinforce interdisciplinary skills and concepts.
For example, in Real Life Algorithms: Planting a Seed, we teach about how the activities we do everyday can be expressed as algorithms.  On our way to this discovery, we touch nearly 20 standards, including CC-Math.1 - Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- The curriculum uses 21st century teaching techniques using a blended-learning model featuring both self-guided tutorials and unplugged activities for students to work in small groups. This help students build persistence and problem solving techniques while increasing their creativity and communication/collaboration skills.
- **Personalize your pitch.** Tell them why you are involved and why you see this being important for them to teach. The mutual factor of every affiliate we accepted was their passion to be a part of this work. Share stories about teachers (or yourself) teaching the curriculum and the students’ experiences.
- **Answer their questions.** Familiarize yourself with our [FAQ](http://support.code.org) beforehand.
- **I don’t know the answer!** Don’t panic! It’s highly likely you will be asked questions that fall outside your knowledge of the K5 program and professional development workshops. Just respond with some version of: “I don’t have the answer to that question at this time. Let me get back to you.”
- **To find the answer** visit our [FAQ page](http://support.code.org) or contact us via the affiliate email or google group. Or attend one of our biweekly affiliate office hour sessions.

# FAQs
**What are the technical requirements for teachers attending my workshop?**

See [this page](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/202591743-What-kind-of-operating-system-and-browser-do-I-need-to-use-Code-org-s-online-learning-system-) for the list of operating systems and browsers Code.org's online learning system supports.

**I was also thinking that I would submit proposals to offer the full-day workshops at a local conference. Is that an appropriate way to offer a workshop?**

Yes this is completely fine! However, Code.org won't reimburse affiliates for travel or fees associated with presenting. 

**Is the expectation for a workshop space to include computers or is it acceptable that participants bring their own computers?   It is acceptable for participants to bring their own computers.**

This is acceptable, but note some teachers may not be able to participate if they do not have their own computer. You will want to communicate this up-front so teachers can prepare accordingly. Also, you **definitely** want the space to have wifi since our tutorials are web based.

**Where do I buy more curriculum guides, swag bags, and/or workshop supplies?**

Easy! Just fill out this short [google form](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/forms/d/1JcqSp7citj3As9l6X7IGEEJbfK3iVVE_uS1iLBPZ1Jk/viewform).
