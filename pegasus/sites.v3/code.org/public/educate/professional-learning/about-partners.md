# About the Code.org Regional Partner Program

Code.org works with United States based organizations, as partners, to help spread computer science in a local, sustainable fashion. Regional Partner organizations serve as K-12 computer science hubs for their region, offering professional learning opportunities for teachers and helping to build a strong local community. 

Our Regional Partners include regional education units, nonprofits, and universities with existing, positive relationships with nearby school districts and the local education community.
