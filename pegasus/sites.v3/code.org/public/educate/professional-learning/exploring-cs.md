# Find the Exploring Computer Science program near you
We welcome teachers to sign up for the [Exploring Computer Science](http://exploringcs.org) (Exploring CS) professional learning program. The Exploring CS program supports teachers with diverse teaching backgrounds. Whether you are new to teaching CS or you have CS teaching experience outside this
course, the program is designed to promote growth in your teaching practice, providing space for teachers to become comfortable with the curricular materials and associated teaching strategies. 


## Where is Exploring CS offered?

The Exploring CS professional learning program is open to teachers in partner districts who are interested in teaching the course. Check to see if your district has partnered to make Exploring CS available in your region for the 2016-2017 school year.
