## Content and curriculum
Code.org provides a complete CS program combining professional learning and the K-12 curriculum, both of which consistently gets high ratings from teachers.

PLACEHOLDER FOR TESTIMONIAL: This was one of the most well thought out curriculums I have seen in any content area. This is the first time that I think I will attempt to truly teach the curriculum from start to finish instead of just picking out the parts I think are useful.

Middle and high school teachers will be participating in the Code.org professional learning workshop for one of the following courses:<br><br>
