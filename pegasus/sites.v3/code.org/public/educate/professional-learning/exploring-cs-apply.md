# Find the Exploring Computer Science program near you
We welcome teachers to sign up for the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) Professional Learning Program. The ECS program supports teachers with diverse teaching backgrounds. Whether you are new to teaching CS or you have CS teaching experience outside this course, the program is designed to promote growth in your teaching practice, providing space for teachers to become comfortable with the curricular materials and associated teaching strategies. 


## Where is Exploring Computer Science offered?

The ECS professional learning program is open to teachers in partner districts who are interested in teaching the course. Check to see if your district has partnered to make ECS available in your region for the 2016-2017 school year. If you live in Idaho, Indiana, Utah, or Virginia, your district is covered by a statewide partnership. Click on the icon in your state to apply.
