Code.org has partnered with the award-winning Project GUTS (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically) to deliver a middle school science program consisting of four instructional modules. An introduciton, life, physical, and earth science modules are blended together to showcase the connection between computer science modeling and traditional middle school science curriculum. 


## What does a Code.org CS in Science Educator do?
If accepted into the Code.org CS in Science Professional Learning Program, you will:

- Join a nationwide community of educators working to change the face of CS education 
- Participate in in-person and online professional development
- Plan and deliver the CSP curriculum to your students, and reflect on your experiences
 
 
## <a name="components"></a>How does it work?
The Code.org CS in Science professional learning program is built with professional development and curriculum that flow together seamlessly, representing one cohesive set of resources that empowers teachers to deliver the course with confidence.

<br/>
Since the program lives both in person and online, participants are supported throughout their first year of teaching CS in Science with a program that is “job-embedded”. Many of the supports, including videos, curriculum, and a crosswalk of CSTA and NGSS standards, are available at the [CS in Science homepage](/curriculum/science).
