## Exploring Computer Science

<img src="<%= CDO.shared_image_url("courses/logo_ecs.png") %>">

Leveraging years of research by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503582&org=CISE), Exploring Computer Science is a nationally recognized introductory college preparatory computer science course and includes curriculum, professional development, and assessments. ECS is composed of six foundational units with lessons that are designed to promote an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning foundational concepts in computer science and highlighting the computational practices and problem solving associated with doing computer science. The PD experience for ECS is based on three major pillars: computer science content/concepts, inquiry, and equity.

## Computer Science Principles

<img src="<%= CDO.shared_image_url("courses/logo_csp.png") %>">

The College Board has proposed a new AP速 course called AP速 Computer Science: Principles.  The course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP速 exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and portfolio-based assessment. Find more information about the CS Principles project at: [http://apcsprinciples.org/](http://apcsprinciples.org/).

Code.org is creating a complete curriculum consisting of daily lesson plans, videos, tutorials, tools, and assessments that covers the learning objectives from the [CS Principles Curriculum Framework](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/comp-sci-principles-draft-cf-final.pdf). The Code.org course materials teach this class in the context of learning about the the Internet and programming in the JavaScript language.
