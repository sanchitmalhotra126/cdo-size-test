Our Computer Science Fundamentals courses have between 14 & 28 lessons (varies by age) that may be implemented by unit or over the course of a semester. Students create computer programs that will help them learn to collaborate with others, develop problem-solving skills, and persist through difficult tasks. They will study programming concepts, computational thinking, digital citizenship, and develop interactive games or stories they can share.

If you like teaching CS Fundamentals, invite other teachers by [sharing this handout](/files/csf-one-pager.pdf).

Our curriculum was created with the [2017 Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) standards](https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards) in mind, but also includes opportunities to support national <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank">Math</a>, <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" target="_blank">English Language Arts</a>, and <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards" target="_blank">Science</a> standards. [View the full standards reinforcement document](https://curriculum.code.org/csf/standards/) for CS Fundamentals Courses A-F.

Our elementary school curriculum can also help students succeed in other subjects as well; a recent [research study by Outlier Research & Evaluation](https://medium.com/@codeorg/code-org-resourceful-teachers-higher-student-achievement-8be1efdec06e) found that 3rd–5th-grade Code.org classrooms with resourceful teachers see higher scores on English, math, and science standardized tests.

Our courses are available at [no cost](/commitment) for anyone to teach. For more information about our goals and the approach to our courses, please see our [curriculum values](/educate/curriculum/values) and our [professional learning values](/educate/professional-learning/values).

No worries! Most of our teachers have never taught computer science before. 

Try one of our courses yourself to learn ahead of your students. Sign up as a teacher to see the lesson plans, join the teacher forums, and get access to all the resources you need.

We also offer high-quality, 1-day workshops at no cost to you or your school. Join other teachers in your area for a hands-on intro to computer science, pedagogy, teacher dashboard, and strategies for teaching “unplugged” classroom activities.

# Selecting the right course for your class

<img src="/images/fit-970/CSFimages/Course_Map.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>

For students new to computer science, each course begins with a grade-appropriate entry point and structured ramp-up of concepts. The progression of Courses A-F builds upon each other to ensure continuing students stay interested and learn new things. This allows you to use the same course at any grade level for all students, regardless of their experience. If you’re looking for a more comprehensive course, the Express Course combines the best of Courses A-F into a single condensed course (with a simpler option for pre-readers). You can download the 2018 version of the [curriculum guide for Courses A-F here](https://code.org/curriculum/docs/csf/CSF_Curriculum_Guide_2018_smaller.pdf).

If you've been teaching Courses 1-4 and want to know how to transition to teaching Courses A-F, check out our [Transition Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dFgrHiW-ERpNGey7yrNcoxU0LEfH9kFbdeLJn2QyJTA/edit?usp=sharing).

CS Fundamentals Express combines the best of Courses A-F into a single condensed course (with a simpler option for pre-readers). We recommend Courses A-F for most classrooms, but if your school only offers one computer science course or you want to have your students work through multiple courses in a single year, the Express course is a better choice. By removing the ramp up between years, the express course provides a smoother path and doesn’t repeat concepts for students unnecessarily. This is also our recommended option for students studying computer science on their own, outside of a classroom.

# International CS Fundamentals: Courses 1-4 and Accelerated

We are working on translating Courses A-F and the Express Course to languages beyond English. In the meantime, we recommend using Courses 1-4 and the Accelerated Course. These courses cover the same basic concepts and have already been translated into 25+ languages.

# Looking for unplugged activities?

If you don't have computers in your classroom, these unplugged lessons can either be used alone or with other computer science lessons on related concepts.
