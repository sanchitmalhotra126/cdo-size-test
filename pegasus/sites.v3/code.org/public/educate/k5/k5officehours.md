# Office Hours for Teachers

Do you have a question about Code.org's curricula that you'd like answered by a Code.org staff member or teacher that has used Code.org courses with their students? Visit Code.org's Office Hours, which is a monthly, 1-hour videochat to help you use our curriculum with your students. Hope to see you there!

All sessions will be recorded and available on this page, so if you can't make a session, you can still watch a session afterwards.
