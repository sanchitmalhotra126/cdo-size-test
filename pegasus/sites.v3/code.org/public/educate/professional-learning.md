## Workshops for Elementary School Educators, free of charge

Code.org offers 1-day workshops to prepare educators and content-area teachers (librarians, tech-ed specialists, etc.) to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun and accessible to the youngest learners (grades K-5). The workshops will cover content for [our elementary school curriculum](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school), and you will receive the supplies you need to teach the courses - at no cost.

## Professional learning for middle and high school teachers


Our middle and high school programs offer year-round support. The program kicks off with a 5-day summer workshop where you'll have an opportunity to work hands-on with the curriculum and meet other teachers from your area. Throughout the year, we offer online support for upcoming units, forum support, and 1-day quarterly workshops. You don't need any prior computer science experience to get started.

## International

Teachers anywhere in the world can use our free, self-paced [online workshop](https://studio.code.org/s/K5-onlinePD) to get started. The intended audience for this online workshop is primary school teachers.

At this point, our in-person  workshops are only available in the United States, but the [curriculum, lesson plans, tools, and support](https://studio.code.org/courses) are available at no cost worldwide. And, [join our forums](https://forum.code.org/) to connect with other teachers for support, teaching tips, and best practices. Our forums are for teachers of all grade levels.

You can also contact our [international partners](https://hourofcode.com/international-partners) for more information on local professional learning opportunities.

## Goals and approach to professional learning

Code.org has worked with partners and experts in the field to develop and support a blended Professional Learning model that embraces the importance of in-person, cooperative workshops and uses online and asynchronous components to provide an ongoing community and support when teachers are in the classroom.

This experience builds on the work of others and recognizes that one size does not fit all. The Professional Learning is tailored for each course and curriculum developed or selected by Code.org. All of our experiences use engaging techniques to prompt teachers to reflect on the pedagogy of teaching computer science while also becoming more familiar with the subject. All include hands-on experiences, collaboration with colleagues, and are accessible to teachers with any or no prior knowledge of computer science.

For the intellectually curious, we've also published our [professional learning values](educate/professional-learning/values) and [curriculum values](/educate/curriculum/values) which we use to guide our own team's effort as well as our work with our education partners.

## Facilitate with Code.org

Code.org's [Facilitator Development Program](/educate/professional-learning/facilitator) is a highly-selective professional learning program designed to prepare and support facilitators to deliver quality workshops on Code.org's curriculum. 

Help bring professional learning opportunities to your community by becoming a Code.org Facilitator!
