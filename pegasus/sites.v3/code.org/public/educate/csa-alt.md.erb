	<p><strong>Introduction to Java Programming</strong></p>
	<p>In Computer Science A, students learn object-oriented programming using Java. Students take on the role of software engineers, and practice skills that are used in the field.</p>
	<p>The Code.org CSA course is designed for any high school student who wishes to continue their computer science education after completing an introductory course such as Computer Science Principles (CSP) or Computer Science Discoveries (CSD).</p>

<h2>What is CSA?</h2>
<p><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a" target="_blank">AP® Computer Science A</a> (AP CSA) is a Java programming course framework and associated <a href="https://ap.collegeboard.org/" target="_blank">Advanced Placement</a> exam introduced by the College Board. It includes content expected to be covered in an introductory college computer science course:</p>
<blockquote>AP Computer Science A introduces students to computer science through programming. Fundamental topics in this course include the design of solutions to problems, the use of data structures to organize large sets of data, the development and implementation of algorithms to process data and discover new information, the analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing systems. The course emphasizes object-oriented programming and design using the Java programming language.</blockquote>
<p>Code.org’s course will cover the content defined in this framework and prepare students for the AP CSA exam. In addition, our CSA course, much like our other courses, is being built with equity at the heart of its design (see details below).</p>

<h2>Who is this course for?</h2>
<p>Code.org’s CSA course is designed for high school students who want to explore the world of building solutions and dreaming up new creations through programming. An ideal next step for students who have discovered a passion for computer science through an introductory course such as Computer Science Principles (CSP), Code.org’s CSA is being designed to engage a wide variety of students, particularly young women and students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups<a href="#urg">[1]</a>.</p>

<h2>Why are we offering this course?</h2>
<img src="/images/csa/csa-why-1.png" style="float:right; width:25%; padding-left:20px">
<h3>To close access gaps for students from underrepresented groups</h3>
<p>In 2020, students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups only made up 14% of AP® CSA exam takers, and young women made up just 25%. We aim to improve upon these numbers by reimagining the structure of the traditional CSA course and provide support and resources to assist teachers in delivering engaging, exciting, and equitable course content.</p>
<h3>To better prepare our students for careers in computer science</h3>
<p>Industry partners indicate to us that students who have CSA experience are more prepared for internships than their peers with CSP experience. This observation has been echoed by partners in Higher Ed regarding student readiness for college level CS courses. With a far larger diversity gap in student participation, CSA needs new ways to engage a wider range of students and prepare them for Higher Ed and industry.</p>
<h3>Because teachers are asking for it!</h3>
<p>Teachers have been advocating for the development of an equitable and culturally responsive CSA course: <strong>84%</strong> of CS Principles teachers told us last year they want to start teaching CSA using Code.org<a href="#84percent">[2]</a>!</h3>
