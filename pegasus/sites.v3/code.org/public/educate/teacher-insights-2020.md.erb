<p>If you’re teaching <a href="https://code.org/educate/csd">CS Discoveries</a> or <a href="https://code.org/educate/csp">CS Principles</a> in the 2020-21 school year and are interested in helping to shape changes we make in the future with our courses, we'd love to hear from you!</p>

<p>We're looking for teachers from a variety of different teaching contexts (including geographical location, experience teaching Code.org, student demographics, classroom setup, etc.) to join the 2020-21 Code.org Teacher Insights Groups for CS Discoveries or for CS Principles. Participants will join a series of hour-long video calls to discuss their experiences with the curriculum, build community with peers, and share feedback with Code.org’s curriculum team. The feedback we collect from the group will be critical in ensuring that our ongoing course revisions address the most pertinent needs of the community.</p>
