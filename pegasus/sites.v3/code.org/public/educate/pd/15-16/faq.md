**What is the payment process?**

### Teacher Payment Process (for those being paid directly by Code.org) ###

Teachers will be paid their stipend at the completion of the online phase (Phase 1) according to when they finish or after the in-person session date (Phase 2). 
</br>
*Note: Phase 1 must be complete in order to receive payment for Phase 2.*

Payments will be made twice a month (these dates apply only to payments by direct deposit):

•Cycle 1: 1st - 15th of each month (payments are pulled the 1st business day after the 15th and are deposited in accounts ~5 business days later)

•Cycle 2: 16th - last day of each month (payments are pulled the 1st business day after the end of the month and are deposited in accounts ~5 business days later)

If, for example, a teacher finishes Phase 1 on Tuesday, May 20, the payment will be processed on Monday, June 2nd and paid by Monday, June 9th. 


### Payment options: ###


Direct deposit: This is the fastest and easiest way to get paid. When registering through the educator information form displayed at the end of phase 1 pd, teachers input the requested bank account information and their stipend will be placed directly into their bank account on the aforementioned day.

Pre-paid debit card: Choosing this option will add 4-6 weeks to the payment process and the card will be sent via mail after processing.

**What if I am no longer teaching the course in the Fall, can I still attend PD?**

Our general rule is you will not go through PD unless you are teaching, but please contact your district to discuss further.
