### **I have a schedule conflict with my workshop date. What should I do?**

Please email pd@code.org *and* your district contact with the workshop date and the reason you cannot attend. <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, you can't make up the workshop. Here are some recommendations for how you can connect with a colleague to catch up on important concepts:<br/> 
1) Locally: Connect with a colleague from your local cohort<br/>
2) Virtually: Connect to your nationwide network of CS teachers through your program's forum: <br/>

### **I am no longer teaching the course. Can I still attend PD?**

Our general rule: We do not pay a stipend to teachers who are not teaching the course.  However, you are welcome to attend the PD, unpaid, as a guest. Please contact you district if you have specific questions about this.

### **Winter Weather Policy**
If a workshop is cancelled due to weather or an unexpected event, Code.org will notify you via email by 10pm the night before PD. If PD is cancelled and not rescheduled for a later date, teachers will still receive the PD stipend. <br/>

Code.org’s goal is to ensure your safety in an emergency situation. Please remember to update [pd@code.org](pd@code.org) with any email or phone changes you may have.

<a id="pay"></a>
### What is the payment process?

**Teacher Payment Process**

**Phase 1 and Phase 2**: Teachers will be paid their stipend at the completion of Phase 2: Blended Summer Study according to their district's payment policy.
</br>
*Note: Phase 1 must be complete in order to receive payment for Phase 2.*

**Phase 3**: Teachers will be paid *separately* for their in-person and online PDs. 
<br />
•In-person: Teachers will be paid for in-person PD in the cycle (see below) following their workshop. Teachers *must* complete the workshop survey distributed at the end of the session in order to receive their stipend. 


•Online: Payment for Phase 3 online PDs will be pulled twice during the academic year - once in the winter and once in late spring. *Note: This does not follow the typical bimonthly payment cycle listed below.* 
<br /> <br />
**Payment Cycles** <br />
Payments will be made twice a month either directly to the teacher or to the district who will then make payments to teachers:

•Cycle 1: 1st - 15th of each month (payments are deposited in accounts or mailed to the district within 10 business days after the end of the cycle).

•Cycle 2: 16th - last day of each month (payments are deposited in accounts or mailed to the district within 10 business days after the end of the cycle).

If, for example, a teacher finishes Phase 1 on Wednesday, May 20th and goes through Phase 2 on June 1st-5th, the payment will be made or mailed by Thursday, June 25th. 
<br/>
<br/>

**Code.org Teacher Payment options:**

Teachers that are **paid directly by their Districts** can be found on [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O1rvNDZ_TfAOfvxQG2wqi9BqG3JsrxG1BV9TruBpt3s/edit?usp=sharing). 

*Note: Code.org is not responsible for delays in payment from districts to teachers. If your district pays you directly, please contact your district finance department with any payment delay questions.*
<br/>
<br/>
Teachers being **paid directly by Code.org** can select from the following payment options:
<br/>
<br/>
**Direct deposit:** This is the fastest and easiest way to get paid. When registering through the [educator information form](https://code.org/educate/educatorinfo)* displayed at the end of phase 1 pd, teachers input the requested bank account information and their stipend will be placed directly into their bank account within 10 days of the close of the payment cycle.

**You may receive a message saying "you can only submit one entry for this form." If you feel like the information that you orignally entered was not correct, see ["I need to update bank account information, where do I go?"](#acct)* 

**Pre-paid debit card:** Choosing this option will add 4-6 weeks to the payment process and the card will be sent via mail after processing. Teachers choosing this option will receive one debit card the first time they are paid, and we will continue to refill that *same* card throughout your PD.
