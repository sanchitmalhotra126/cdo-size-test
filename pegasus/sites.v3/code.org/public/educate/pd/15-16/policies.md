# Code.org Professional Development Policies and Procedures

## Teacher Attendance Policy ##

Districts are required to select teachers who will be teaching the course in the fall, that are able to attend all days of professional development (for high school there are four phases over 15 months, for middle school there are three phases over 12 months), and teachers must commit to attending all days of professional development (PD) when joining a Code.org cohort. 
</br>
</br>

1. Teachers will only receive stipends for the hours that they **attend** the professional development.
2. Arriving/leaving over 30 minutes late/early will count as a full day absence if not approved by Code.org **prior** to the workshop.
3. Teacher must complete phase 1 PD prior to the start of phase 2 PD to continue to be part of the program and will not receive his/her phase 2 PD stipend until phase 1 PD is completed.
4. Teacher must attend the full [5 days High School/3 days Middle School Science/2 days Middle School Math] of phase 2 PD to continue to be part of the program.
5. Teacher must be teaching computer science to a minimum of 1 section of students when the school year begins to continue to be part of the program.
6. Teacher must attend all [4 days of High School/2 days of Middle School] Saturday in-person workshops (these happen during the school year) to continue to be part of the program.
7. Teacher must complete all required portions of phase 3 online PD prior to the start of phase 4 to continue to be part of the program.

</br>
Exceptions to this policy include districts where Saturday workshop participation is voluntary per union regulations.

## Teacher Payment Process (for those being paid directly by Code.org) ##

Teachers will be paid their stipend at the completion of the online phase (Phase 1) according to when they finish or after the in-person session date (Phase 2). 
</br>
*Note: Phase 1 must be complete in order to receive payment for Phase 2.*

Payments will be made twice a month (these dates apply only to payments by direct deposit):

•Cycle 1: 1st - 15th of each month (payments are pulled the 1st business day after the 15th and are deposited in accounts ~5 business days later)

•Cycle 2: 16th - last day of each month (payments are pulled the 1st business day after the end of the month and are deposited in accounts ~5 business days later)

If, for example, a teacher finishes Phase 1 on Tuesday, May 20, the payment will be processed on Monday, June 2nd and paid by Monday, June 9th. 


### Payment options: ###


**Direct deposit.** This is the fastest and easiest way to get paid. When registering through the educator information form displayed at the end of phase 1 pd, teachers input the requested bank account information and their stipend will be placed directly into their bank account on the aforementioned day.



**Pre-paid debit card.** Choosing this option will add 4-6 weeks to the payment process and the card will be sent via mail after processing.
