## What should I do if I have phase 1 registration issues?

The registration e-mail was sent on May 1st at 3 pm ET. Please check your spam folder to see if you have an e-mail from register@code.org. Alternatively, if you go to [http://edx.code.org/register](http://edx.code.org/register), you can create an account with your school e-mail address. 

After registering, you will receive an email from registration@code.org to activate your account. Once you activate you account, the course should be automatically added to your dashboard. 

For step-by-step instructions with pictures [click here](/files/edXaccount.pdf).

Please contact pd@code.org if you have further issues.

## What should I do if I log-in issues with the online PD? ##

Please first double check that you are at the correct log-in website: [edx.code.org/login](http://edx.code.org/login). You will not be able to access the Code.org course if you are attempting to log-in at edx.org

If you are still having issues, please reset your password by clicking on "forgot password?" and then click "reset password." You will receive an email with instructions for setting a new password.

If you continue to have log-in issues, please email pd@code.org.

<a id="question"></a>

## What if my question is not saving on edx.code.org? ##

The latest version of Internet Explorer is not compatible with [edx.code.org](http://edx.code.org/) and using Internet Explorer 11 prevents teachers from saving their work. Please download and use Firefox or Google Chrome when working on [edx.code.org](http://edx.code.org/) and your work will be saved.

## Who do I inform if there is a schedule conflict? ###
The Code.org policy on teacher attendance can be found [here](/files/TeacherAbsencePolicy.pdf).

Please e-mail pd@code.org if you have a conflict with an in-person PD date.

## What if I miss a live Hangout?

If you were unable to attend a live Hangout, you can still get credit by watching the recording of the Hangout in the courseware section of your [edx.code.org](http://edx.code.org/) account.

## What is the payment process?##

### Teacher Payment Process (for those being paid directly by Code.org) ###

Teachers will be paid their stipend at the completion of the online phase (Phase 1) according to when they finish or after the in-person session date (Phase 2). 
</br>
*Note: Phase 1 must be complete in order to receive payment for Phase 2.*
<br>
You will be paid either directly by Code.org or indirectly by your district. For further details about how payments will be processed by your district or to you directly, please see the notes below. 

1. Stipend payments are processed by Code.org every two weeks on the **1st** and **15th** of each month.
<br /> 
2. Please note that there is a **5-10** business day processing time for your payments to be received directly by you or the district.
<br /> 
3. Once the payment has been released to the district, it is up to the **district** to determine when they will distribute the funds. 


### Payment options: ###
**Additional Information for Teachers Paid Directly by Code.org**
<br />
If you are paid directly you will need to fill out our sitpend payment form found at <https://code.org/educate/educatorinfo>. These forms are submitted directly, through an encrypted connection, to our finance department. The information in these forms will allow finance to process your payment automatically when the payment cycle is reached. 
<br />
<br />
As part of the stipend payment form, you will need to fill out both a bank account information section and a W9 form. If either form contain errors, you will be contacted directly by a Code.org staff member who will ask you to resubmitt your form, either electronically or by fax.   
<br />
If you do not receive your payment please contact <PD@code.org> and let us know what Code.org PD program you are enrolled in, your school name, your school district, and school email address. 


**Direct deposit.** This is the fastest and easiest way to get paid. When registering through the educator information form displayed at the end of phase 1 pd, you will input the requested bank account information and your stipend will be placed directly into your bank account on the aforementioned day.



**Pre-paid debit card.** Choosing this option will add 4-6 weeks to the payment process and the card will be sent via mail after processing.

## What if I am no longer teaching the course in the Fall, can I still attend PD?

Our general rule is you will not go through PD unless you are teaching, but please contact your district to discuss further.
