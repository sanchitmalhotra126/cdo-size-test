### What Assessments Looks Like
With the exception of the final projects, there are no specific assessments listed in the lesson plans.  There are also very few specific “homework” assignments.  Differences in grading policies, types of assessments required, and student schedules make it difficult to gauge the best combination of assessment tools to use in a particular environment.  Teachers are encouraged to determine which class activities might lend themselves to some research outside of class and which might make useful assessments.
