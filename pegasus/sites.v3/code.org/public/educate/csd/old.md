# Accessing old versions of CS Discovery Units 1 - 3 during the 2016/2017 school year

Throughout the course of the 2016/2017 school year the CS Discoveries team has been writing and releasing draft units of our new curriculum. These units have been used by teachers both inside and outside of our formal pilot, and we've received a lot of useful feedback from those piloters.

In order to prepare for the full rollout of CS Discoveries, we have been working to address the most significant areas of concern based off pilot feedback. Often these changes can happen in place without significantly affecting those teaching the course, but some of our changes that are intended to address the pacing issues require a more significant restructuring.

To get these units ready for professional development during the summer, and to give some of our piloters an opportunity to try out the revised curriculum with their classes, we will be deprecating old units and replacing them with our revisions.

_Note that this only affects teachers using Units 1 - 3, revisions to Units 4 - 6 will take place after the close of this school year._

## What changes have been made?

### Unit 1

* De-emphasize binary and provide greater support of input-output-storage-processing
* Lesson 5 (Binary Cards) reworked and moved to Unit 5
* Lesson 6 (Processing with Bits) removed from the curriculum
* Added two new lessons highlighting the input-output-storage-processing model

### Unit 2

* Personal Web Site project revised to increase student choice and decrease logistical difficulties
* Decreased reliance on external tools
* Dispersed unplugged lessons throughout the unit

### Unit 3

* Drawing lessons shortened
* Introduction to sprites moved forward
* Focus on variables shifted to focus on the counter pattern
* Long lessons have been split in two

## What if I want to teach the original versions?

We realize that changing these units up mid-year can be disruptive for classrooms. While we encourate you to transition to the revised units if it makes sense for your classes, the original units will remain available until **July 1, 2017**. Old versions of the units can be accessed at the following URLs.

**If you are teaching Unit 1**, take a look at the lessons you have taught and the lessons we have changed. Due of the unplugged nature of this unit, you should be able to transfer to the new version without much worry.

**If you are teaching Unit 2** many lessons have been rearranged, but most content has remained. Take a look at the new version and decide whether to transfer your students over, and where you might pick it up.

**If you are teaching Unit 3** and have gotten past lesson 9 the only change between the old and new units will be a change in lesson numbering. If you are still in the first 9 lessons of the course, take a look at the new version and decide whether to transfer your students over, and where you might pick it up.

The new units will be located at the same URLs as the old ones were, so if you choose to move to the revised versions you won't need to do anything. If you would like to keep your classes in the old versions, you will need to assign students to the Code Studio units listed in the table above. If you plan to use the old units, take note that student progress will be kept, but **the green bubbles won't show up**.

## When will this all happen?

The new versions of Units 1 and 3 went live on **Friday, April 21**. The updated Unit 2 will go live at the end of the day **Friday, May 12**, giving you that weekend to transfer your classes over to the old script if you need to.
