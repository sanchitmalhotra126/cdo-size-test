# When Will CS Discoveries Standards Maps be Published

CS Discoveries was written using both the K-12 Framework for Computer Science and the draft CSTA standards as guidance. Because the revised CSTA standards have not been finalized yet, we are holding off on publishing formal standards mapping documents to ensure that we have an opportunity to address any changes that may appear in the final draft.

Once the CSTA standards have been finalized and published, we will complete a full pass to articulate, on a unit and lesson level, our mapping to not only the the CSTA standards, but also select ISTE, Common Core Math, Common Core ELA, and NGSS standards. Once this mapping has been completed, it will be available here as well as in lesson plans.
