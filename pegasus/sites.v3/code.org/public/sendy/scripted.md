I know you care about computer science, so I want to tell you about this local opportunity to help.

[ScriptEd](http://www.scripted.org/) is a NYC-based nonprofit that teaches web development and computer science to students in underserved high schools. It's looking for volunteer software developers to help teach in classrooms throughout New York City. 

This is a great way for senior developers to share their expertise, and for new developers to solidify their skills by teaching the next generation. 

New volunteer trainings are coming up in late-August and early-September. If you are interested, [sign up here to get involved](bit.ly/ScriptEdVolunteer).

For more questions, email [info@scripted.org](mailto:info@scripted.org).

**Volunteer Commitment**<br />
ScriptEd classes are held 2x a week throughout the school year. Classes are held either in the morning (approx. 8:00 – 9:30 am), or after school hours (approx. 3:30 - 5:00 pm). It depends on the school. Volunteers must commit to teach 1-2 days per week.

**Volunteer Training**<br />
ScriptEd volunteers must participate in new volunteer training and complete partner schools’ background checks. A ScriptEd staff member will contact you about each of these requirements after you apply to volunteer.
