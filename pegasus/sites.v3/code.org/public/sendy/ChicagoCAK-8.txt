## Welcome back to school!  
**We at Code.org haven’t forgotten about you**

To start off the year, we’d love to share 5 ways to be successful throughout the fall when implementing Exploring Computer Science.

* Strategize your classroom setup to let the students work in small groups, and have the opportunity to journal, reflect and share 
* Take on the role of the facilitator instead of the lecturer, allowing for student inquiry and ownership of their learning, in addition to circling around the groups as they discuss to help guide them with questions in the right direction if they need
* Remember the three strands of ECS: Equity, Inquiry, Computer Science Content when you are planning
* Take time to look ahead at the lessons so you can look for connections between the lessons and plan for needed supplies
* Make time to network with other teachers who teach ECS 

Over the course of the coming school year we’ll be working together in-person and online to help support your teaching of the ECS class. The online PD activities will be situated between our face-to-face meetings, providing more opportunities to reflect on specific teaching strategies, approaches to activities, and to consider what’s most effective for our students. Just like before, these online activities will happen in the code.org's edX space (available at [edx.code.org](http://edx.code.org)).
