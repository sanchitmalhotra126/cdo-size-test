Subject: Important Information: Upcoming Exploring CS PD 10/18 @9am

Greetings Everyone,

I hope that your school year is off to a great start. This is a reminder that the second mandatory Exploring CS PD is next Saturday, October 18 from 9am-330pm. Lunch will be provided. 

There are several important things to note for this PD. Please be aware of the following:

1. Howard's homecoming game is that same day, at 1pm. The parade, which runs down Georgia Ave, begins around 9am. EVERYONE IS URGED TO PLEASE METRO. You WILL NOT be able to park on campus, as you did last time. Between the parade, the game, and everything else going on, many of the traditional options are blocked off, making travel and parking virtually impossible. Please be aware of this and plan accordingly. We will still begin promptly at 9am.

2. This PD is focused on Units 3 and 4. To ensure that there is sufficient time dedicated to lesson planning and teaching, please download Scratch v 1.4 from the scratch.mit.edu website prior to Saturday. In addition, we ask that you please figure out (if you don't already know) how to save an HTML file in notepad or TextEdit, depending on whether you have PC or Mac. If you have any confusion, please contact me.

3. We will be joined by 12 additional educators, from Montgomery County Schools. We welcome you to Howard! Our location is 2300 Sixth St. NW (Room 2114-second floor). Everyone should note there will be a lot more traffic in the building, due to the timing. 

Again, we ask that you please take the metro to campus, even if you drive into the District and park elsewhere near another metro stop and take the metro in from there. We are located at the Shaw-Howard stop (Green Line). When you exit the metro (directly under UNCF), make a right and travel up Georgia Avenue (crossing Florida). The LK Downing building (same as before) is approximately 6 blocks up from the metro (the first driveway after passing Subway and Frozen-Yo on the right).

Great points to park and catch the metro are the Mt. Vernon/Convention Center, Chinatown, or Metro Center park. Should you attempt driving and parking, I would suggest parking around the U St. corridor (between 14th and 10th) and walking over. You will have to walk several blocks. However, you may have a better chance since you are arriving early. Please note if there are meters you will have to pay on Saturdays. 

Thanks and we look forward to seeing you on next Saturday!
