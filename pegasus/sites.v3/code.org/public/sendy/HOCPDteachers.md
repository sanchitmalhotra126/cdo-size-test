Dear Educator,

Last December, 15 million students tried computer science in one week thanks to educators like you! Since then, over 40 million students have tried the Hour of Code.

**Hour of Code 2014 - let’s reach 100 million students**  
You've taught Code.org courses, so you know how fun this can be for students. Use the Hour of Code to re-engage students with new tutorials. Please, help us grow the movement and reach every student at your school this year!


**No experience needed from teachers and students**  
We owe it to today’s students to start with one hour. Let’s make history.

Sign up to participate, recruit a fellow teacher, or get your whole school to join the fun. 

Start now at [http://hourofcode.com](http://hourofcode.com)
