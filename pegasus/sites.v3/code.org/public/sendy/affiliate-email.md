Dear Elementary Teacher:

Code.org needs your help in understanding how you are using the K-5 Code.org courses. As you know, you are among the first to use these courses. Your input will help us make them better for you and other teachers in the future. 

**We encourage you to be honest; this questionnaire is being administered by our external evaluators, so Code.org will not know how you, as an individual, responded.**
<br >
<br />
**How you can help:** Take this survey about your Code Studio experience:

If you complete the survey, you will be entered into a drawing to win one of 25 gift cards, worth $20 each!
 
**Timeline:** 
Please do this as soon as possible!
