### Welcome to the 21st Century
Computer science is foundational for all students today. Yet most schools don’t teach it.

Last December, 15 million students tried computer science in one week thanks to educators like you! Since then, over 40 million students have tried the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com).
