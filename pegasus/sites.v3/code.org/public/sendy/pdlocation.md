Dear Educator,

It was brought to our attention that the October 18th Phase 3 Professional Development coincides with Howard University's homecoming on campus. The homecoming parade starts on Georgia Ave at 9am and the homecoming game is at 1pm. Campus roads will be blocked and therefore driving and parking on campus will not be possible.

Howard University recommends taking the Green Line Metro to the Shaw-Howard stop on Georgia Ave. After getting off the metro, walk .5 miles north on Georgia Ave to the LK Downing Engineering Building. 

Please also find additional details on the session below:
