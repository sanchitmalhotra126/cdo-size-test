## Hi Educators,

At the Code.org office, we've been working away all summer to make an awesome new teacher dashboard! Now when you log into your teacher account, you can:

- **Use a secret word or picture instead of a password for kids to log in with. Great for young kids who have trouble remembering words but will remember cute characters** [![Code.org](/images/dashboard-login.png)](/)
- **Create accounts for your students, one off or in bulk** [![Code.org](/images/dashboard-addstudents.png)](/) 
- **Print log-in cards for your studentsâ€™ account information** [![Code.org](/images/dashboard-cards.png)](/) 
- **See your students' progress presented in a more visual and useful way** [![Code.org](/images/dashboard-progress.png)](/) 
- **Remove students from your dashboard regardless of whether they have an email associated with their account**
- **View and reset students' secret pictures or words**
- **Assign a classroom to any of Code.org's new courses for K-5 students. Check out the new courses here, in teacher preview: [http://studio.code.org/beta](http://studio.code.org/beta)**
