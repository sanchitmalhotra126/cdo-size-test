**Start with an Hour of Code**

The [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. [Sign up](http://hourofcode.com) to host an [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) this December 8-14 during Computer Science Education Week and help reach 100 million students by the end of the year. If you did this last year, you know that students loved it. Try to go even bigger, get every student at your school participating. We’ll have **new tutorials** for all ages and ones that require no computer at all. Watch the [video](http://hourofcode.com), and ask all educators to give it a shot. **Every participating educator will receive thank you gifts.** 50 classrooms will win tech chats with special guest speakers.
