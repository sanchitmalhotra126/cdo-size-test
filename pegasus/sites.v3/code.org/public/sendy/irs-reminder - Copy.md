Dear Educator,

Quick reminder about stipend payments. Your stipend for professional development is being paid by Code.org, not your school district. This means that the stipends are regarded, by the IRS, as independent contractor work. The amount of tax to be paid on money earned form professional development will vary by state, please check with a local CPA about amounts that should be withheld.

More Information can also be found at IRS Self-Employment Tax website.

In addition, we wanted to remind you of Code.org's payment process, which can be found on our FAQ, and has been referenced here for your convenience:

>Teachers will be paid their stipend at the completion of the online phase (Phase 1) according to when they finish or after the in-person session date (Phase 2). Note: Phase 1 must be complete in order to receive payment for Phase 2.

>Payments will be made twice a month (these dates apply only to payments by direct deposit):

>* Cycle 1: 1st - 15th of each month (payments are pulled the 1st business day after the 15th and are deposited in accounts ~5 business days later)

>* Cycle 2: 16th - last day of each month (payments are pulled the 1st business day after the end of the month and are deposited in accounts ~5 business days later)

>If, for example, a teacher finishes Phase 1 on Tuesday, May 20, the payment will be processed on Monday, June 2nd and paid by Monday, June 9th.

We hope that this email clarifies any questions about professional development payments and tax rates, but if you have any other questions please feel free to email PD@code.org.
