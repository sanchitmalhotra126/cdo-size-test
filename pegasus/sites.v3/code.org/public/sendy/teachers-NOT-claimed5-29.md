## Hi Educators,

Thanks so much for teaching our K-8 computer science course!  There is still time to earn up to $1,000 in classroom funding by helping your students complete the course.

As a reminder, here's how the rewards work:


1. To qualify, help 15 or more of your students complete the K-8 Intro to Computer Science course.
2. When the 15th student earns his/her last badge, you’ll be sent an email on how to redeem your prize. You can also visit [studio.code.org/redeemprizes](http://studio.code.org/redeemprizes) to access your gift code.
3. If 7 or more of your students are girls, you’ll earn an extra $250 DonorsChoose.org gift code.

To redeem your gift codes for amazing classroom resources like document cameras, furniture or 3D printers, follow  [these instructions](http://www.donorschoose.org/docs/Teacher_gift_code_instructions.pdf).

### In other Code.org news,
We’ll be debuting our [new curriculum](http://code.org/educate/curriculum) for elementary school students over the summer. We’ll have 3 different levels which are distinct courses:

- Level 1: **Kindergartners and 1st grade**
- Level 2: **2nd and 3rd grade**
- Level 3: **4th and 5th grade**

All three courses will be based off of the current K-8 course, which will still be available moving forward. (If you’re interested in attending a professional development workshop for the new K-5 courses, request a spot [here](http://code.org/educate/k5).)

And it’s never too early to mark your calendars for this year’s **[Hour of Code](http://code.org/educate/hoc),** which will be held during Computer Science Education Week, **December 8-14, 2014.** Mark it on your district’s calendar and start spreading the news!

Have an amazing summer!

### Thanks for all you do,

Katie & the Code.org team
