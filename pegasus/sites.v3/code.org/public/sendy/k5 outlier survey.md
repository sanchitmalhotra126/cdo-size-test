I'm reaching out because you successfully lead students through our K-8 Intro to Computer Science course this spring. I want to invite you to apply to become a Code.org Affiliate.

We're launching a new K-5 program this summer and are recruiting qualified teachers who will prepare local elementary teachers to teach Code.org's new elementary courses. If you have a background in computer science or experience hosting professional development, you may be a great candidate!

### **How to Become a Code.org K-5 Affilliate**
[Become a Code.org K-5 Affiliate](https://docs.google.com/a/code.org/forms/d/1Sz1L4KXT-1K56XL4ThmbFuvcJCoUkKy_Vjw-gmulcK8/viewform) by attending a 2-day, expense-paid workshop in Las Vegas, Nevada. Code.org will train affiliates to deliver their own one-day, in-person workshops to local educators interested in teaching the [Code.org K-5 curriculum](http://code.org/educate/curriculum). Already over 400 elementary school teachers have signed up to attend local workshops.

As an official Code.org affiliate, you can host workshops that will be listed on Code.org's website, and together, we will recruit elementary school teachers to attend these workshops in order to offer computer science modules in their classrooms.

### **What does a Code.org K-5 Affiliate do?**
- Attend our train-the-trainer workshop in Las Vegas August 22nd - 24th
- Plan and host professional development workshops for elementary teachers near you
- Recruit elementary school teachers to attend workshops. (Target: 60 teachers/semester).
- We will provide marketing help, promotional materials, etc.
- Run workshop logistics and operations including:
	- Signing up teachers
	- Finding a location
	- Recruiting teaching assistants to help you (if necessary)
	- Returning an evaluation report

### **What does a Code.org K-5 Affiliate receive?**
For each workshop, Code.org affiliates will receive a per-teacher budget to cover costs, and also to compensate you as well as any teaching assistants.
