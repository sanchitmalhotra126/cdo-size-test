## [Name,fallback=]

You're receiving this email because you entered your name at [Code.org](http://code.org/) as a potential volunteer to help teach kids computer science, and we've identified an opportunity in your local neighborhood.

[Code.org](http://code.org/) is sending this email on behalf of TEALS (Technology Education and Literacy in the Schools). TEALS is a grassroots program that trains and places software professionals into classrooms at schools that do not offer C.S. courses. Volunteers teach not only the students, but also a local teacher who attends with the expectation of taking over the class in future years, to establish a sustainable program. Participating as a teacher in TEALS is a 3-4 hours / week commitment during the school year.

If you're interested, below are some links about the TEALS program:

- [Map of partner schools you could teach at](http://tealsk12.org/schooldisplay/schools-viewonly-maponly.php)

You can apply to volunteer by **May 7th** at [http://www.tealsk12.org/apply/](http://www.tealsk12.org/apply/).

If you have any questions, don't reply to me, instead send email [info@tealsk12.org](mailto:info@tealsk12.org)

Sincerely,

Hadi Partovi,
Founder, [Code.org](http://code.org/)
