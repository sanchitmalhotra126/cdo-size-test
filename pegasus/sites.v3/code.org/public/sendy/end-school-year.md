## The Hour of Code is coming… again! December 8-14

Thanks to educators like you, last December’s Hour of Code movement just keeps growing. By now, 37 million students have tried computer science for the first time with the Hour of Code!

We hope to make this December’s campaign even BIGGER. So before you leave for summer, **mark your school calendar now for the Hour of Code 2014, coming December 8-14.**

## Check out new Code.org courses

**By fall, we’ll offer:**

- 3 levels of elementary courses (K-1, 2-3, 4-5)
- Free, one-day curriculum workshops for elementary teachers beginning in September. [Sign up to be notified](http://code.org/educate/k5) when a workshop is scheduled in your area.
- Middle school programming activities for math and science classes. [Learn more](http://code.org/educate)

Check out [our current courses](http://studio.code.org) for a preview of what’s to come: all **free**, open source and available worldwide.

I can’t wait to share more Hour of Code news this fall and together hit our goal of reaching 100 million students by the end of the year!
