### Office hours ###
Code.org will start holding office hours on Thursday, October 9th from 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm ET and 5:00 pm - 6:00 pm PT.  It is a great chance to get together with other ECS teachers and discuss classroom issues, new ideas, strategies that are working for you or to answer questions that you might have. There will be an ECS teacher or facilitator and a Code.org Operations team member present during each session.  

Please submit any questions you would like to have answered ahead of time to PD@code.org. A full schedule of Code.org office hours can be found on the [PD website](http://code.org/educate/pd/supports#hs).

### Aspiration in Computing Awards for High School Females ###
Please encourage your female students to apply for the NCWIT Aspiration in Computing Award http://www.aspirations.org/.  The application is very short and approachable. Award recipients receive two engraved awards: one for her, and one for her school's trophy case. They also receive opportunities for scholarships, internships, research experiences, and other educational and employment opportunities provided by NCWIT member organizations

This great award celebrates female students who love using computers and and have shown an interest in using those skills to share with others in their school and community.  It is not about ability, aptitude or results girls have shown in computer class. For example, a student shouldn't be afraid of applying if she has only had CS for 2 months.  There are both local and national awards. The application deadline is November 2nd.


### Hour of Code ###
The Hour of Code is coming the week of December 8-14!

If you didn't participate last year, it’s an introduction to computer science designed to show that anyone can learn the basics. Code.org provides hour-long tutorials for your computer, tablet, smartphone, or with no computer at all! 

We’d love to have you, your classes, school and district participate to help reach 100 million students.  Will you help grow the campaign by recruiting more teachers from your school to participate for one hour this year? No CS experience needed from teachers and students.

You or your school can sign up to participate or see activities and resources at our website  [http://hourofcode.com](http://hourofcode.com).  Start by signing up today!
