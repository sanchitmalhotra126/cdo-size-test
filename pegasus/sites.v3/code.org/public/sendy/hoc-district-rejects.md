You wrote Code.org to establish a partnership, and at this time a high school and middle school partnership for professional development isn't possible (yet).

But **good news**- you can bring computer science to your district without a formal partnership. 

**Grades K-5**

Our [courses for elementary school students](http://code.org/educate/k5) are fantastic.  We offer amazing, zero-cost, [1-day workshops](http://code.org/professional-development-workshops) to prepare educators to introduce computer science basics in a format that's fun and accessible to the youngest learners (grades K-5).  

The courses combine online learning with "unplugged" classroom activities. The professional development workshops are facilitated by a nationwide network of talented computer science educators, at no cost. Attending teachers will even receive free supplies for the unplugged activities.

Please check out the [courses](http://code.org/educate/k5), see if we offer a [workshop near you](http://code.org/professional-development-workshops), and ask your elementary school principals and teachers to participate.  ***And please offer "PD credit" to your teachers who attend these workshops successfully.*** 

**An Hour of Code - for ALL students**

Lastly, help us recruit every school to host an [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com) for ALL students, across ALL grades. If you did this last year, you know that students loved it. Try to go even bigger, get every student participating. Watch the [video](http://hourofcode.com), and ask all educators to give it a shot. Every participating educator will receive thank you gifts. And in each state one participating school will win $10,000! Put your district on the map! http://hourofcode.com



Thank you so much for all you do for our children and our future,

Hadi Partovi 

Founder, Code.org
