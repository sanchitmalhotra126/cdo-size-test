Dear Educator,

Last December, 15 million students tried computer science in one week thanks to educators like you! Since then, over 40 million students have tried the Hour of Code.

Hour of Code 2014 - let’s reach 100 million students
You taught Code.org courses, so you know how fun this is for students. Use the Hour of Code to re-engage students with new tutorials. And help grow the campaign by recruiting more teachers and schools to do it this year!

What’s an Hour of Code?
It’s an introduction to computer science designed to show that anyone can learn the basics. Code.org provides hour-long tutorials featuring Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Angry Birds, and Plants vs. Zombies — for your computer, tablet, smartphone, or with no computer at all! 

No experience needed from teachers and students
We owe it to today’s students to start with one hour. Let’s make history.

Sign up to participate, recruit a fellow teacher, or get your whole school to join the fun. 

Start now at http://hourofcode.com
