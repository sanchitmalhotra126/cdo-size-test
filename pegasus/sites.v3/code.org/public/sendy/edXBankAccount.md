Dear Educator,

We are writing to let you know your stipend payment was processed, but bounced due to incorrect bank account information. There are two ways you can update your bank account information: 

1. Go to [https://code.org/educate/educatorinfo](https://code.org/educate/educatorinfo) and resubmit your bank account information  
2. Complete the attached bank deposit form and fax it back to us at 866-241-8505  
 
If you update your bank account information prior to September 15th, your payment will be processed in the next batch.

Please email <pd@code.org> if you have further questions.

Thank you,

The Code.org PD Team
