Hi,

You were one of the awesome organizers who helped make Hour of Code 2013 an [insane success](http://hourofcode.com/). Thank you, thank you, thank you for your support!

We haven't yet heard if you're participating in the Hour of Code for this year’s Computer Science Education Week (December 8 - 14, 2014).

**Please let us know, and [sign up to join the global celebration all over again](http://hourofcode.com/).**

### If you don't sign up, you can still host an Hour of Code, but you'll miss out on: 
1. Free posters 
2. Free stickers for every student 
3. A special thank-you gift 
4. The chance to win ridiculous prizes that we still haven't announced :-)
5. The chance to introduce more students to the fun and opportunity of computing (and special new tutorials we’ll soon unveil)
