# Free Laptops for AP CS Principles Students through College Board and Amazon Future Engineer

## About the Program

The College Board has partnered with Amazon Future Engineer to provide **free laptops for AP CS Principles students who do not have access to one at home** and therefore cannot continue studying or complete their Create and Explore Performance Tasks. The laptop will be shipped freely to your home so that it can be used for the AP exam and you can keep it afterwards - itâ€™s your laptop to inspire ongoing learning. 

## How to Make a Request 

Go to [cb.org/tech](http://cb.org/tech) where you can quickly put in your request. **We recommend you put in your request as soon as possible** as availability is limited and laptops will be given on out on a first-come, first-served basis.

## Who Should Take Advantage

This program is designed specifically to benefit students who lack access to a laptop or Chromebook at home and are unlikely to get access to one in time to complete and submit their Create and Explore Performance Tasks. [The College Board has announced](https://www.collegeboard.org/ap-covid19-updates) that both tasks are due at 11:59pm ET on May 26th, 2020. **We strongly encourage teachers to share this opportunity by whatever means they can with students they know currently lack access to a laptop or Chromebook at home.**
