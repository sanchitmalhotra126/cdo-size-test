## What is computer science?
Computer science is about learning how to build technology that'll change the world as we know it. It covers how the Internet works, how to analyze big data and how computers impact our lives. Students also learn to code as a tool to create the programs, games and apps of the future.

## Exploring Computer Science
Exploring Computer Science is an inclusive class for high school students with no prior experience required. Students will learn how to solve problems with computer science, cover how it fits into our culture, and practice basic skills for areas like web design, robotics, data analysis and computer programs.

### More info
ECS is organized around six units:

- **Human Computer Interaction**. Design basic user interfaces for web sites and apps.
- **Problem Solving**. Take complicated problems, break them down into smaller pieces and use computers to help solve these parts of the puzzle.
- **Web Design**. We all use the web every day -- but how many of us know how to design and build their own website?
- **Introduction to Programming**. Learn the basic building blocks of computer programming.
- **Computing and Data Analysis**. Learn how to manipulate and analyze data, which people do every day, in every field.
- **Robotics**. Programming a robot to carry out your commands is fun. Bring everything else you've learned so far together to make your work come to life. 

## AP Computer Science Principles
AP Computer Science Principles is a deeper dive. Itâ€™s rigorous, but engaging and approachable, college-level course. Students will learn how computer science is transforming the world we live in and how they can create and collaborate using it. Curriculum will provide daily lesson plans, videos, tutorials, and assessments. This class is currently in a pilot phase with an AP exam coming in 2016-2017.
