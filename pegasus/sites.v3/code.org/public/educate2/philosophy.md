[<button>K-12 Professional Development Philosophy and Goals</button>](http://code.org/educate2/professional-development-philosophy)


## Code.org's Educational Philosophy

### We believe that:

1. There is more to computer science than coding; we’re just called Code.org because it’s short and snappy.
2. Students should learn the why of computer science, not just the what and how.
3. Technology should be used to allow a teacher to do what they do best, which is why we promote a Blended Learning model  (not just for students, but for teacher PD as well).
4. Learning computer science is useful no matter what field a student eventually goes into.
5. The best learning is relevant and active.
6. Computer science is creative and exciting, and you can use it to make the world a better place. 
7. Students are diverse, both in their prior knowledge and their needs as learners. They deserve to learn in an environment that is equitable and accessible. 
8. Failure is good. Students need to learn how to persevere in solving difficult problems.
9. Bringing computer science to K-12 schools nationwide is something that we’ll achieve by all working together. It won’t be one person or one organization.
10. It doesn’t matter if you’re 8 years old, an 8th grade teacher, or 80 years old; anyone can learn computer science.
