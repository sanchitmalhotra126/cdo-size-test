We welcome teachers to sign up for the Exploring CS professional learning program. The 15 month program will provide an intro to computer science, curriculum, and assessments. Exploring CS is composed of six units with lessons that are designed to promote an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning foundational concepts in computer science and highlighting the computational practices and problem solving associated with doing computer science. The Exploring CS professional learning program is based on three major pillars: computer science content/concepts, inquiry, and equity.
