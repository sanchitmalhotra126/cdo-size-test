## What should I do if I have phase 1 registration issues?

The registration e-mail was sent on May 1st at 3 pm ET. Please check your spam folder to see if you have an e-mail from register@code.org. Alternatively, if you go to http://edx.code.org/register, you can create an account with your school e-mail address. 

After registering, you will receive an email from registration@code.org to activate your account. Once you activate you account, the course should be automatically added to your dashboard. 

For step-by-step instructions with pictures [click here](/files/edXaccount.pdf).

Please contact pd@code.org if you have further issues.

## What should I do if I log-in issues with the online PD? ##

Please first double check that you are at the correct log-in website: http://edx.code.org/login. You will not be able to access the Code.org course if you are attempting to log-in at https://www.edx.org/

If you are still having issues, please reset your password by clicking on "forgot password?" and then click "reset password." You will receive an email with instructions for setting a new password.

If you continue to have log-in issues, please email pd@code.org.

## What if I miss a live Hangout?

If you were unable to attend a live Hangout, you can still get credit by watching the recording of the Hangout in the courseware section of your edX account.

<a id="pay"></a>
## What is the payment process?##

### Teacher Payment Process (for those being paid directly by Code.org) ###

Teachers will be paid their stipend at the completion of the online phase (Phase 1) according to when they finish or after the in-person session date (Phase 2). 
</br>
*Note: Phase 1 must be complete in order to receive payment for Phase 2.*

Payments will be made twice a month (these dates apply only to payments by direct deposit):

•Cycle 1: 1st - 15th of each month (payments are pulled the 1st business day after the 15th and are deposited in accounts ~5 business days later)

•Cycle 2: 16th - last day of each month (payments are pulled the 1st business day after the end of the month and are deposited in accounts ~5 business days later)

If, for example, a teacher finishes Phase 1 on Tuesday, May 20, the payment will be processed on Monday, June 2nd and paid by Monday, June 9th. 


### Payment options: ###


**Direct deposit.** This is the fastest and easiest way to get paid. When registering through the educator information form displayed at the end of phase 1 pd, teachers input the requested bank account information and their stipend will be placed directly into their bank account on the aforementioned day.



**Pre-paid debit card.** Choosing this option will add 4-6 weeks to the payment process and the card will be sent via mail after processing.

## Who do I inform if there is a schedule conflict? ###

<a id="question"></a>

## What if my question is not saving in Phase 1 on edX? ##

The latest version of Internet Explorer is not compatible with the Phase 1 courseware in edX and using Internet Explorer 11 prevents teachers from saving their work. Please download and use Firefox or Google Chrome when working on Phase 1 and your work will be saved.

## What if I am no longer teaching the course in the Fall, can I still attend PD?

Our general rule is you will not go through PD unless you are teaching, but please contact your district to discuss further.
