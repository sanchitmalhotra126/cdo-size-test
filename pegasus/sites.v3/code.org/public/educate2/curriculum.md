little blurb

## Middle School ##

There are two interdisciplinary modules at the middle school level: CS in Science and CS in Math. Each module exists as multiple sets of topical lessons that are able to be integrated into pre-existing Science and Math classes.

## High School ##

Leveraging years of research by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503582&org=CISE), the core courses in Code.org's high school package, [Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/) and [Computer Science Principles](http://www.csprinciples.org/) have been designed to broaden participation in secondary computer science and prepare students for post-secondary experiences related to computing or college majors in computer science. 


### [Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/) (ECS)
Exploring Computer Science is a nationally recognized introductory college preparatory computer science course and includes curriculum, professional development, and assessments. ECS is composed of six foundational units with lessons that are designed to promote an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning foundational concepts in computer science and highlighting the computational practices and problem solving associated with doing computer science.

The PD experience for ECS is based on three major pillars: computer science content/concepts, inquiry, and equity.

### [Computer Science Principles](http://code.org/educate2/csp) (CSP)

The College Board has proposed a new AP速 course called AP速 Computer Science: Principles.  The course is designed to be far more than a traditional introduction to programming - it is a rigorous, engaging, and approachable course that explores many of the big, foundational ideas of computing so that all students understand how these concepts are transforming the world we live in. The official AP速 exam is set to go live in the 2016-17 school year with an exam and portfolio-based assessment.
