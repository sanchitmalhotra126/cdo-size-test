## What is computer science?
Computer science is about learning how to build technology that'll change the world as we know it. It covers how the Internet works, how to analyze big data and how computers impact our lives. Students learn to code as a tool to create the programs, games and apps of the future. Plus, they build foundational skills like problem solving, creativity and logic. 

## Elementary School Computer Science Program

<br/ >

There are three levels of computer science at the elementary school level:

- Course 1: for early-readers, ages 4-6
- Course 2: for beginners, ages 6+
- Course 3: for ages 6+

These experiences blend online, self-guided and self-paced tutorials with "unplugged" activities - lessons that teach computing concepts without a computer.  Each level consists of about 20 lessons that may be implemented as one contiguous unit or one lesson a week for a semester. The courses have been designed for students of all ages and they align to and integrate national standards in Technology, Computer Science, Math, Science, and English.

Teachers, try our [K-8 Intro to Computer Science course](http://studio.code.org), which is a preview of what the elementary school courses will look like. See an [overview of Code.org's K-5 curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VBgpBodJgIouJejMoijXFV0BbAHVUqSeN_ZJAR-HEP8/pub)

**Professional development opportunity:** In the fall, we will offer free workshops nationwide for educators interested in teaching our K-5 curriculum. Request a workshop and we'll let you know when one is available near you.
