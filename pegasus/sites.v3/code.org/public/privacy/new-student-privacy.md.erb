# Code.org courses in Computer Science

Software and technology are everywhere - in our computers, pockets, cars, and homes. With 67% of computer science jobs taking place outside of the technology sector, CS is foundational, but most schools don’t teach computer science.  Whether they want to pursue a career in software, or to be a more well rounded citizen in the 21st century, we’re proud to introduce our classroom to some of the basics of computer science using Code.org.

## What is Code.org?

Code.org offers a fun, creative platform for learning basic coding and computer science! Using a blended learning model, Computer Science Fundamentals courses blend online and "unplugged" non-computer activities to teach students computational thinking, problem solving, programming concepts and digital citizenship.

 Most importantly, students will learn skills that extend beyond CS and have a blast doing it! Our research shows that students rate computer science and the arts the highest of all their subjects. [View more stats about CS.](/stats)
 
### Students will study topics such as:
- How the Internet works
- Basic computer programming
- Logic, problem solving and creativity
- Creating simple apps, animations, and “code art”

### With an online course, students are able to benefit from a truly modern educational experience. For example, Code.org is able to:
- Make tutorials smarter and more personalized
- Use data to identify where students get stumped and improve puzzles
- Use smart hints to guide students with custom answers to common mistakes

### Student login - for access outside the classroom 
Because this is an online course, students can log in from outside the classroom - from a computer or tablet at home, or in the library.  For our classroom to participate in this course, we have created Code.org accounts for each student.

## Protecting student privacy
Code.org assigns the utmost importance to student safety and security and has designed Code.org to maximize student privacy.  In particular, **participation in this course doesn’t require sharing any private student information online**. The online course requests the student’s display name, which can be represented as an alias (eg “John S” or “Cool coder”).

The list below summarizes what student data is stored and protected by Code.org, and how it is used. You can find further details by view our [Privacy Policy](http://code.org/privacy).

### Data that Code.org collects from students participating in the course:
- Student display name (e.g. “John S” or “Cool coder”)
- Age (to protect the privacy of the youngest learners)
- Progress in the course (to display reports for students and teachers)
- Login date/time and other technical information (for debugging purposes)

### Optional data:
- Scrambled “hash” of email address. If a student creates an account directly (without a parent or teacher), they will login using their email address, but Code.org will never receive the actual email address, only a scrambled “hash” that can’t be converted back to the original. 
- Gender or race (to anonymously summarize aggregate participation in computer science, to track progress towards increasing diversity in the field).
