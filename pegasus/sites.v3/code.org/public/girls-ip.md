# Inspiring Girls to Learn Computer Science

Computer science is foundational to many fields and students of all genders report being not only interested in the subject but confident of their abilities as well. Despite this, not enough girls are choosing to study it. Here are some proven methods for encouraging girls to try computer science:*

## It’s Simple. Start by telling them they’d be great at it!

Research shows that around age 12 both boys and girls have a similar level of interest in computer science. This difference is that <b>women are half as likely to be encouraged to explore it</b>.  That’s especially important considering that students who are told by a parent or a teacher that they’d be good at the subject are up to 3x more likely to be interested in learning CS in the future.

Perhaps the single most effective way to get women into CS classes is also one of the simplest! Take a moment out of each day to tell a female student that you think she’d be great at CS.

## Challenge stereotypes and present positive role models

Research has found that simply seeing someone “like me” can be a powerful influencer for girls, and that spans more than gender. Displaying [images of role models](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources#posters) in your classroom can be a powerful tool for motivating girls. Defy stereotypes and show a diversity of race, cultural backgrounds, and even passions or interests so that students don’t feel like they have to fit into a one mold in order to belong. <br><br>

## Explain that computer science can impact the world in every field

Both boys and girls care about making the world a better place and may not be aware of how computer science can contribute to this. In fact, only 22% of girls say they’re very likely to one day have a job where they need to know CS. 

You can help by showing examples of CS careers that blend academic skills such as problem solving with intrinsic social causes like conservation or medical care. When students see that a career in CS can be rewarding in a variety of ways, they’re more likely to continue pursuing their interest. 

Take a look at some [great examples](https://code.org/careers-in-tech) of how everyday people are using CS in their careers.

## Show them a day in the life of a CS professional

Dispel misconceptions about what a future in computer science looks like by using our [inspirational videos](https://code.org/educate/resources/inspire), many of which feature women in a variety of creative and impactful industries! 

Students have positive attitudes about science careers when they’re able to see what a day in the life really looks like, especially if it’s highly collaborative. In addition to [videos that dive deep into potential careers](https://code.org/careers-in-tech), it’s a great idea to connect with a local university or college’s CS department to coordinate a school visit or guest speaker.
