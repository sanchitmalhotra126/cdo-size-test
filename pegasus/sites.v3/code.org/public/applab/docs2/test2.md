# Lesson Overview 

In this lesson, students work in groups using classroom supplies and everyday objects to develop their own systems for encoding and sending simple binary messages - messages that only have two possible values. Students will think about what can be usefully conveyed in a such a simple message and build a "device" to communicate the message over some physical distance.  Students will collaborate in an iterative design process in the “maker ethos” of rapidly building and improving their “device” for sending messages.

# Curriculum Connections

One of the least understood things about the internet is how it actually works as a physical system.  Bits of information actually physically travel from one place to another.  In this lesson students build their own way to transmit a single binary digit, or "bit", of information with themselves as the recipients, interpreting the transmission.  The value of this activity is beginning to create the mental construction of a “stream of bits” which underlies much of our understanding of the Internet and how it works.  On the “real” internet bits are transmitted using a variety of different mediums as well, and most of the time a single bit physically travels over a variety of systems to get where it’s going.  We want to understand the issues in the physical transmission of bits as a separate problem from interpreting and encoding the messages sent on top of those systems. After the next few lessons we will treat the physical internet as an abstraction - a system capable of transmitting bits without concerning ourselves with exactly *how* they are transmitted.

## Getting Started

- **Thinking Prompt****: **Consider the computing innovations that we discussed in the previous class period. In your journal, make a list of of  innovations that rely on the ability to send information from one place to another. Head the list: "Innovations that Send Information"

- **Discussion**: 

**Goal**: the goal of this discussion is to extract the idea that when you get down to it, information is composed of a pretty finite set of things.  Students might say: text, numbers, sound, images, movies and be hard pressed to think of much more. Your discussion will set up the next several lessons, which are going to explore how information is sent between devices, and how it’s understood once it’s been sent. 

    - Do a whip around ([or other group share-out strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VsjE_cQqh3kcpCOasLDtamio9dd9IkH38aJFzfsVxjE/edit?usp=sharing)) to get ideas from students out into the open.

    - Consider: what types of information are transmitted with these innovations - what are the fundamental elements that make up the information? For example a text message sends text (duh).  What other kinds of information besides text are sent from one place to another?

Transition into activity...

## Activity

- **Introduce the binary-message sending challenge: **

    - Briefly introduce the concept of a binary message:The simplest type of information that can be sent in nature is a BINARY message.  The word "binary" is not actually a term from computing.  “Binary” is used to describe a state of things that involve only two possibilities.  For example, the question “Do we have a quiz today?” is a binary question - there are only two possibilities. We might call this a “natural” binary question because the answer is yes/no, true/false, etc. A binary question can also be “artificial” where you make up two possible answers, like a choice between two things.  For example: Which do you prefer more: Coke or Pepsi?  Country music or hip hop? etc.

    - Get the activity started with a quick **thinking prompt**:*You and your best friend have not been able to communicate for the entire summer, and you have a chance to ask her one binary question that she will answer. What question do you want to ask?  *

        - Encourage students toshould develop meaningful questions of personal interest -- not questions that are always have the same answer (i.e does  2+2 = 4?, or is grass green?) 

        - You might need to clarify the difference between a "natural" and “artificial” binary question described above.

        - Invite students to share their ideas with the class. Record some of the questions on the board or other display. 

- Transitional remark: a single binary message may not be all that interesting after a while.  But what is interesting is how one might actually transmit that message. Today we will focus on *how* a binary message can be sent over a distance.  You will build the device that sends it.

- **Create a device using common classroom items to send simple binary message **([Student Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s3qa6U2mPFSH_n6Uf0I9IHV2FOzXtOlxZ3LSTOM3JTQ/edit?usp=sharing))

- Create groups of 3 to 4 students (pairs might be okay here)

- Provide students with the maker supplies, including items like small flashlights, cups and string, pieces of paper with different colors on each side, tape, paper, etc. 

- Challenge Guidelines: 

    - **Your task is to create a device or method for sending a single binary message** from one side of the room to the other without the sender or receiver moving location.  *That means that their device must be able to signal one of two possible states to someone standing on the other side of the room.*

        - *Teaching Tip: you might start referring to these two states as state A and state B.*

    - **No language. **Students cannot communicate their selection with visual, written, or oral language. (e.g. they can’t just yell across the room or send notes with writing on them).

    - **No projectiles. **There can be no free-flying objects (e.g. they cannot throw things to each other). This is a safety precaution but also forces students to be more creative.

    - Encourage students to test and iteratively improve their designs* as* they reach, what appears to them, to be "the end." Repeatedly encourage them to make their design better and better.

- It should not take too long for students to develop a system for sending a basic message when they have direct line of sight.

- After they have that, **modify the challenge: **students must modify their device or strategy** **so that the message has to travel around a corner (or with something blocking line-of-sight)

    - Things for students to consider while modifying their devices: 

        - What if someone obstructs view?  

        - What if the recipient is not paying attention?  

        - How do you know the message was received correctly?

    -  

- Encourage students to try to make their method of signaling as simple and as fail-proof as possible.

- Ask students to demonstrate their device for you and try to present them with challenges they might not have considered.

- **Demonstrate**** the messaging ****systems **

    - Have students complete a table similar to the one shown below (example in italics) and record in a journal.  They will need to refer to this in the next lesson.

**The Question:** *Do we have a quiz or test today?*

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>state</td>
    <td>The possible messages</td>
    <td>Instructions for how to send with your device</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>quiz</td>
    <td>one tug on string</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>test</td>
    <td>two quick tugs on string</td>
  </tr>
</table>


    - Invite each group to demonstrate its solution to the class.

    - During the presentation Invite the students in the audience to ask questions, pose potential difficulties, discuss the challenges and share ideas they may have.

    - Encourage the presenting group to discuss improvements that they would like to make and challenges they encountered in creating their solutions. 

## WRAP UP

- If it doesn’t come out during the presentations or the follow-up discussions, guide the class to examine the limitations of the project.

- The communication challenges of being able to send only a binary message (two possible states).

- The need to agree ahead of time on what the signals mean.

- The lack of security -- once the communication strategy is known it is easy for anyone to understand the message.

    - Encourage students to think about security while working on their design. It is not a requirement at this time and will be dibout security while working on their design. It is not a requirement at this time and will scussed in depth later.

- **Reminder: ***do not* destroy the binary message-sending devices.  We need them tomorrow.

- **Journal Entry:**** **Students can record their reflection individually or as a team. Students should write these prompts in their journals and record their responses.

Reflection: 

    - In 100 words or less: What was the most challenging aspect of building a binary message device and how did you and your partner overcome it?

## EXTENDED LEARNING

- Switch devices with another group. Make sure you get their instructions for indicating state A and state B. Using their device, send your message to your partner. why is this possible? 

- **"**What binary messaging systems are currently used in this room, your home, or school? How effective are they?"

Possible answers include: smoke detector, metal detector, and cell phone ringtones.

## ASSESSMENT 

- What are the most important aspects of coordination when trying to send a single binary message from one place to another?

- What **can’t** be represented in a binary message? 

- Could you use another group’s device (and the associated instructions for how to indicate state A and state B) to send your message? Why or why not? 

- **"**What binary messaging systems are currently used in this room, school, or at home? How effective are they?"

Possible answers: Many kinds of alerts or notification systems are binary in nature.  smoke detector, metal detector, some traffic signals, brake lights on cars, cell phone ringtones, etc.  

Similarly, vibrations can signal a variety of conditions based on length or number.
