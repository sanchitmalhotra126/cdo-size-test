## Prep for the Hour of Code:

**Choose a tutorial for your students**

- Check out the [tutorials](/learn) and pick one for your class. 
- Go through the tutorial yourself so you can help students during the Hour of Code.
- Test tutorials on student computers or devices. Make sure they work properly (with sound and video).
- Preview the congrats page to see what students will see when they finish. 
- If the tutorial you choose works best with sound, provide headphones for your class, or ask students to bring their own.

**Plan ahead based on your technology available**

- Don't have enough devices? Use [pair programming](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning). When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They’ll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
- Have low bandwidth? Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos.

## During your Hour of Code

**Inspire your students - show them a video**

Check out [these videos](http://youtube.com/codeorg), featuring Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Black Eyed Peas founder will.i.am and NBA star Chris Bosh talking about the importance of programming.
(There are [1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYZF6oIZtfc), [5 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc), and [9 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA) versions)

**Get your students excited - give them a short intro**

Most kids don’t know what computer science is. Here are some ideas:

- Explain it in a simple way that includes examples of applications that both boys and girls will care about (saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
- Try: "Think about things in your everyday life that use computer science: a cell phone, a microwave, a computer, a traffic light… all of these things needed a computer scientist to help build them.”
- Or: “Computer science is the art of blending human ideas and digital tools to increase our power. Computer scientists work in so many different areas: writing apps for phones, curing diseases, creating animated movies, working on social media, building robots that explore other planets and so much more."

## Start your Hour of Code

**Direct students to the activity**

- Write the tutorial link on a whiteboard. 
- Tell students to visit the URL and start the tutorial.

**When your students come across difficulties**

- Tell students, “Ask 3 then me.” Ask 3 classmates, and if they don’t have the answer, then ask the teacher.
- Encourage students and offer positive reinforcement: “You’re doing great, so keep trying.”
- It’s okay to respond: “I don’t know. Let’s figure this out together.” If you can’t figure out a problem, use it as a good learning lesson for the class: “Technology doesn’t always work out the way we want. Together, we’re a community of learners.” And: “Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won’t be fluent right away.“
 

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

- Students can try more [tutorials](/learn/beyond)
- Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.
