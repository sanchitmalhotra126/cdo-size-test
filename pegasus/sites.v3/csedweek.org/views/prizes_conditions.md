- Every host must [register](/participate) for the Hour of Code under the "Host an Hour of Code" tab. Then, as a “school,” “teacher,” or as an “after-school club or camp."
- If your entire school participates in the hour of code, each educator must individually register as an organizer for the Hour of Code to redeem Dropbox space.

- **You will receive an email after CSEdWeek** (Dec. 9-15) with instructions on redeeming your Dropbox space with a unique code.
- The first 100,000 organizers who register and host an Hour of Code will win (There will be plenty surplus gifts, see how many are currently organizing [here](/events)).
