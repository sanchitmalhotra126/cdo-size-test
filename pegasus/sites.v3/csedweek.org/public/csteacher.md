# Participation Kit - for Computer Science Teachers

In addition to the Hour of Code, here are some things you can do to celebrate CSEdWeek.
NOTE: Please celebrate CS Education throughout the year, with highlighted activities whenever it’s convenient for you, your students, your school.	

## How can you promote computer science during CS Ed Week 2014?

## 1) Host an event

| Sample Events ||
|------|----------------|
| [Competition](#compete) | [Career Awareness](#career)|
| [Awards Ceremony](#awards) | [Presentations](#present) |
|[Hands on](#hands) | [Gaming](#gaming) |

## 2) Engage your students 

| Sample Activities ||
|------|----------------|
| [Grades K-2](#activities) | [Grades 3-5](#activities)
| [Middle School](#activities) | [High School](#activities) |

## 3) Involve others
- Any group can host a CSEdWeek event, whether it is a church, boy scouts, local university, library, YMCA, veterans association, or labor union. If you have connections to any such organizations, reach out to them, send them a [participation guide](http://hourofcode.com/us/resources#handouts), and encourage them to visit <http://csedweek.org> and participate.
- Make sure to see NCWIT's [10 ways to recruit girls to CS](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/top-10-ways-recruiting-high-school-women-your-computing-classes/top-10-ways-recruiting) for ideas on activities to grow participation by women.
- Provide topics for discussion on how computer science impacts the disciplines at your school. (English, Math, Science, World Language, Dance, Theater, Arts, …)
- Bring other teachers and administrators into the conversation by asking them to host a discussion on how computer science impacts their discipline
- Meet with your middle school to show the course offerings and importance of CS education to them. Start with [one of these videos](http://hourofcode.com/us/resources#videos).

## 4) Garner Support 
- Pitch CS education to your local school board, superintendent, or principal. Start with [these PowerPoint slides](/files/CS-pitch-basic-stats.pptx), [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLXrN0Yguk&feature=c4-overview-vl&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNe1WmdkMG-Ca8cLQpdEAL7Q), or [these talking points](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/moving-beyond-computer-literacy-why-schools-should-teach-computer-science)
- Ask your local Congressman to support the Computer Science Education Act
- Ask your governor (or other local official) for a [CSEdWeek proclamation](/public/csteacher/proclamationinstructions).

# Sample Events
<a id="compete"></a>
## Competition
- Problem Solving Competition
- Poster Session 
- Design a music video competition and present to a larger group of students
- Have a robot tug-of-war - students design and build robots for a tug-of-war
- Nightly challenges students submit online. First correct submission wins a prize.

<a id="career"></a>
## Career Awareness
- Reach out to your local four year CS department chair about having your students visit a university.
- Reach out to your local chamber of commerce to have students visit a local employer that depends on computing professionals.
- Invite alumni who are working in a CS-related career (keep it broad) to come talk to students. Several alumni from various occupations works well.
- Have students interview their parents and grandparents.  Ask them how computing has impacted their lives. Then have students provide their own perspectives on how computing has impacted their lives.
- Find a local Computer Science Teachers Association Chapter and plan a joint event

<a id="awards"></a>
## Awards Ceremony
- Hold a birthday party to celebrate Grace Hopper’s birthday, December 9. Use it as a way to celebrate the role of women in Computer Science.
- Hold a raffle, where students can win prizes, announce certificate awards for CS accomplishments.
- Find a local vendor to sponsor a “give away” for awards

<a id="present"></a>
## Presentation
- Do an open house of your course offerings for parents, explain how CS connects to 21st century jobs.
Host a tour of your computer facility with students as guides 
- Engage a speaker on a Computer Science topic
Have students demonstrate the work that they have been doing 
- Arrange a student visit to a neighboring school to demonstrate what you have been doing and see their work
- Set up a technology fair
- Find a local Computer Science Teachers Association Chapter and plan a joint event
- Have a movie evening (Suggested titles: War Games, TRON, Social Network)

<a id="hands"></a>
## Hands On
- Include your students’ families by inviting them to school to learn about CS. Some examples: Have a “[Scratch Day](http://family.media.mit.edu/)”  where parents come and learn Scratch from you and your students.
- Declare a “Bring your own device day” to solve computational problems available online, show your favorite game and explain how computing makes that game possible, etc.
- Set up a workshop for a specific topic: Scratch, Alice, Green Foot where students can try their hand at designing 
- Hold a Twitter event

<a id="gaming"></a>
## Gaming
- Find a local university with a game design class and volunteer to test and critique the games
- Have a “Game Hour” where students can play and compare their favorite games
- Invite students to compete in a specific set of games
