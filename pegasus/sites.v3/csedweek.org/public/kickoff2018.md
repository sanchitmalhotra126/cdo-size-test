# CSEdWeek Kickoff Event

## December 3, 2018 - Seattle, WA

Every year, Code.org kicks off Computer Science Education Week with a signature event – at the White House, opening the stock market, or in Silicon Valley with leading women in tech, like Sheryl Sandberg, Susan Wojcicki and Peggy Johnson.

This year, for the first time, we’re thrilled to be kicking off the global celebration 
right here in Seattle!

Join us at our kick off event to launch Computer Science Education Week 2018, to celebrate the accomplishments of the CS education community, and to make new announcements and pledges to K-12 computer science. The event will also feature a short Q&A with Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
