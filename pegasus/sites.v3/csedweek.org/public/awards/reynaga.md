<br/>
Using an Adafruit, Crystal Reynaga and another female student developed a GPS connected wristband that paired with a mobile app to help parents keep track of their young children. They were featured in La Opinion and Telemundo, two Spanish language news media. They also were invited to film a segment of Math@Work with the stars of Shark Tank.
