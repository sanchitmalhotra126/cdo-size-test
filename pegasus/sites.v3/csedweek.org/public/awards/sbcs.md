# South Bend Code School

<br/>
<br/>
Through our formal programs, we introduced over 200 students in Indiana and Michigan to coding in two years and exposed 700 students to coding through community outreach. We started a scholarship fund for our students and our classes are 47% female, 56% under-represented, minority, and 50% split in socioeconomic diversity. 	

In our first program, 19 students (with 0 prior coding knowledge) coded 23 websites in 5-weeks. Four of their websites were civic applications, promoting non-violence in the city of South Bend. Those students went on to present their applications to the Mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg, in a community-wide presentation. Afterwards, they traveled to Google offices in Chicago to present their applications to Google team members and spend the day learning from industry experts. Thus, South Bend Code School was born and our tradition for introducing youth to the power of coding (youth learning coding through community apps, hosting community presentations, and visiting local tech companies). Two years later, we have had the privilege of coding with over 200 youth in our formal program and 700 through our community outreach efforts. We have worked with students in the Juvenile Justice System or other less than ideal life situations. However, through coding, we have given those students more hope and created coding alumni programs for students to continue learning and offer students opportunities such as job and internship placement, college and scholarship application assistance, and tutoring in core academic areas. In the past year, we have helped 12 students earn internships with local tech companies and 14 students to attend college to pursue undergraduate degrees in both STEM and design. With the help of code.org, we have partnered with local schools to help ensure that students receive computer science as a part of their normal school days.
