# Anacapa Middle School

<br/>
<br/>
The Hour of Code exploded schoolwide! We went from 60 participants the first year to having our early adopter students become the teachers who provided classroom support to 791 of their peers. What’s more, this was a multi-lingual event in which students provided coding opportunities in English, Spanish and Arabic.	

We are a Title 1 school that had a single teacher sign up for Hour of Code. Mrs. Steinlicht taught her students about Computer Science using a borrowed set of Chromebooks. In year two, students were eager to expand Hour of Code into a week-long experience where they would become the teachers. 

Students were trained, emails sent schoolwide, and Chromebooks were borrowed from a variety of departments. Students wrote a script and translated directions into Spanish & Arabic. During our Week of Code, students went across the campus in teams of four to issue Chromebooks and sign students up for a special Google Classroom, as well as Hour of Code. 

Teachers were impressed by the students’ ability to teach, assist, and support all students including English Language Learners and Special Education students. We had sixty students teaching coding in English, Spanish, & Arabic to 791 students schoolwide (out of 900 total students). After this experience, several teachers and students expressed interest and now we have two Computer classes that are teaching Computer Science topics. In addition, Mrs. Steinlicht is coordinating with our District to make more coding opportunities available for all.

This year, we already have students signed up to teach and support another Week of Code. We plan to expand and are coordinating with our feeder elementary schools. It has been an exciting movement to make Computer Science accessible for ALL students. What started with one teacher, has been taken over by our students. We could not be more proud!
