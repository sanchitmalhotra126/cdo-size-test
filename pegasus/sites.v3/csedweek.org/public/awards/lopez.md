Mr. Lopez initiated the AP Computer Science program at Laredo ISD and is the only CS teacher out of the four high schools. Enrollment increased from 9 students in 2015-2016 to 40 students in 2016-2017 (100% Hispanic), including a significant number of at-risk and English language learners.

Mr. Lopez introduced a CS Principles pilot to Nixon High School (99% minority enrollment), the first time computer science had been offered at Laredo ISD in over 10 years. Despite starting with only 9 students in 2015-2016, he recruited and brought on board 40 students to AP CS Principles in 2016-2017. Out of the 40, 25% of the students were labeled “at-risk” and 20% “limited English proficient.”

His students achieved a 75% passing rate for AP CS Principles, significantly outperforming the school average of about 20% AP passing rate overall. Some that passed had never taken a Pre-AP, Honors, or AP course of any kind.
In addition, despite not offering AP CS A, Mr. Lopez started an after-school Programming Club where students studied Java, which resulted in three students challenging AP CS A exam (100% passing rate). This prompted administration to approve both AP CS Principles and AP CS A as official courses, the only two computer science courses offered in the whole district.

In addition, the Computer Science Club he coached placed 2nd at the District Competition (Rio Grande Valley) and 3rd Place at the Region Competition (Mid and South Texas), an incredible feat for first-timers.

Bringing computer science prompted several of the students that graduated in May to pursue computer science when entering college, and some current students are planning to pursue it post-graduation.

This year, enrollment for AP CS Principles and AP CS A is now at 63 students, a number unthinkable just 2 years ago.
