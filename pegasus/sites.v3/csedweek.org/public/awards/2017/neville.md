This year, with the encouragement of Dr. Lisa Milenkovic, STEM/Science Supervisor for Broward County, Diane Neville and Gulfstream Academy of Hallandale Beach, Florida have embraced coding in a big way! Ms. Neville has created customized course sections so that all students are able to experience high levels of success while learning to code. Student's enthusiasm and their personal motivation to learn have sky rocketed because of this approach. Ms. Neville finds it amazing that students are voluntarily devoting a significant number of hours to coding on their home computers. Enrolled in the course are 15 severely developmentally delayed students, 46 speakers of other languages, 69 minority students and 28 Honor students. 84% of all enrolled students are living below the poverty level.	

At long last school is fun for these struggling students. It is very rewarding to know that what I am teaching in school could very well help this often under estimated students to see their way out of poverty.
