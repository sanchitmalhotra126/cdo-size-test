# Heather Sutkowski

As a teacher, Heather Sutkowski has advocated to not only provide CS education to all students in her own school (grades K-6), but she has worked to be the voice for CS education at the Elementary level by working closely with the CT State Department of Education and other members of the CT-CSTA to continue advocacy work across the state for grades K-12, and higher ed.

At the CREC Montessori Magnet in Hartford, CT, Computer Science is now a weekly class for all students in grades K-6. The demographics include over 250 full-day students, 50% female, 57% students of color, and 56% receiving free/reduced lunch.

In the past year she has presented at PTA meetings, volunteered time to promote the Hour of Code at local conferences (statewide and international), trained K-5 teachers in Connecticut as a Code.org CSF Facilitator, met with district superintendents to advocate for CS, and supported local CS events. She has also volunteered as part of the CT State Department of Education's Computer Science Advisory Group to research and advise on certification and standards requirements related to CS, and have also presented to directors at the CT State Department of Education with other CT-CSTA colleagues.

The school has committed to teaching computer science on a weekly basis to every child, and continuing to participate in a schoolwide Hour of Code. This has been a large step forward, because in the previous four years, only a small number of students were given CS instruction in specific classrooms, during pull-out group time or in the summer school program, and they were able to slowly increase to now reach every student in the 2017-2018 school year.
