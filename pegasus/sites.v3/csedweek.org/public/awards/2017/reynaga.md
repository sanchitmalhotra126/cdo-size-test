# Crystal Reynaga

<br/>
Using an Adafruit, Crystal Reynaga and Angela Johana Garcia Pena developed a GPS connected wristband that paired with a mobile app to help parents monitor their young children. They were featured in La Opinion and Telemundo, two Spanish language news media outlets. And they were also invited to film a segment of Math@Work with the stars of Shark Tank.
