Vidhi Srivastava, a freshman at Redlands High School, founded STEM for All Foundation, a nonprofit organization to champion STEM education for all students. Over the past two years, she has conducted training sessions for administrators, teachers and students in Scratch from MIT, AppLab from code.org, and Alice3 by Oracle.

Vidhi Srivastava is the Founder and President of the STEM for All Foundation, a nonprofit organization, that aims to promote STEM education and encourage all students, especially girls and other underrepresented sections of society to pursue careers in STEM. Vidhi is a freshman at Redlands High School, Redlands CA and has a passion for STEM. She believes that coding is an essential skill that all students should master as they are applicable across all content areas. In addition, she believes that coding should be included in the curriculum of all schools at all grade levels to make traditional classrooms more interactive and attractive for students.  She wants to expose students to the creative possibilities of the era of digital textbooks, which are highly interactive, non-linear, cloud-based and incorporate video, audio, links, and search capabilities.

To promote the concept of including coding in curriculum, Vidhi has developed several projects in Scratch, App-lab and Alice that manifest her understanding of Common Core Standards across content area. She is campaigning for students and teachers to use coding as a presentation tool and has successfully presented to teachers and administrators at various county (RCOE MaTHink & Google Summit), state (California Math Council & California STEAM Symposium), and national level (CUE) conferences. She started coding in elementary school and was presenting at state level conferences by the time she was in 7th grade.
