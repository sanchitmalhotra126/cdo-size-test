# Shreya Shekhar

<br/>
<br/>
Shreya Shekhar has always been very passionate about computer science and believes that it can make a tremendous impact in any field. In pursuit of a way to contribute to these impacts, she did an internship in Bioinformatics to build a tool with R to treat cancer using precision medicine.	

Blending computer science with creativity for solving human problems has always interested Shreya greatly. During her research internship, Shreya not only enhanced her knowledge in genomics but also gained tremendous insight into usage of computational techniques in the treatment of diseases. She self-taught R programming language and its use in data sciences. She applied Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Machine Learning to analyze genetic datasets obtained from Cancer Genome Atlas. She built a tool for assessing biomarkers identified from profiles of patient tumor samples, along with clinical metadata to assist in personalized treatments for effective management of cancer in patients of similar genetics. Her application of Machine Learning algorithms helped increase accuracy in deriving models that could predict the best drug regime. Currently, she is writing a paper on her research with the intention of contributing to cancer treatment. 

In addition to the knowledge gain, Shreya was able to realize her aspirations of using her computer skills to aid medical research and solve medical problems so people can lead better quality lives. It gave her immense satisfaction to be able to contribute in her own small way in transforming how we use genetics in medicine and help aid future generations from this deadly disease.
