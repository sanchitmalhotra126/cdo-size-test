# Queen City Robotics Alliance

<br/>
<br/>
Team 3506 hosted coding summer camps for refugee children in collaboration with Project 658.  	

For the past two years, YETI has used the Code.org curriculum to introduce refugee children to the vast world of STEM through coding. The refugee children at Project 658 were elementary and middle school students who came from places like Turkey, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. Training for the camp counselors (YETI students) was held prior to the camp, at CPCC, so they could learn the Code.org curriculum and become certified to teach the program. Each of the camps lasted one week and the students from YETI guided the children through a series of activities that involved basic coding and coding properties. By incorporating physical activities with online activities, students were able to get a better grasp on the key concepts of coding. They initiated the code camps in hopes of empowering these children with STEM ideals by giving them an introduction to STEM skills.
