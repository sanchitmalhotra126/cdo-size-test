# Brenham High School

<br/>
<br/>
Brenham High School is a rural high school in Texas that had no Computer Science opportunities until 2013. Veteran Cross Country coach Trenton Hall convinced administration to Computer Science classes and also purchasing a 3D printer. In 2014, the students took on the challenge of 3D printing a prosthetic hand for a local boy. Since then, the CS classes have created a total of 8 prosthetic hands and arms. They are currently working on developing a robotic prosthetic arm for a local girl.

The first CS class at Brenham High School had 10 students. The opportunity to participate in real-world projects that help people in need has led to increased interest in taking Computer Science in Brenham. There are now over 75 students taking coding classes at Brenham High School. The district has also expanded efforts to promote coding to every student in the district. A district-wide push to participate in the annual Hour of Code event has led to most elementary students having some exposure to coding activities in Brenham ISD.

Brenham ISD has created a STEM advisory committee for the 2017-18 school year to investigate ways to create more opportunities for students in STEM and improving computer science opportunities is one of the top priorities. Founded in 1875, Brenham ISD is the oldest public school district in Texas. As a leader in Texas education BISD is looking to set the standard for what is possible through Computer Science.
