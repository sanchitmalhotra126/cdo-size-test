Lawrence Ramos started a coding class at Emerson as a teacher initiative, that is very much part of their affiliated charter status. When he started in 2015, he had a very limited knowledge of coding, with his experience limited to what he saw his elementary students doing. He immediately went to get training for Code.org and implemented the Accelerated course. In his second year, he expanded to Scratch and acquired Arduino kits through DonorsChoose. This year, even without the formal training, he implemented the CS Discoveries and so far is doing well in as far as implementation is concerned.

He was reluctant at first when he got an offer to teach at a middle school. He is a special education teacher and all he knew was his purpose is to give as many opportunities for students of all demographics and abilities. When he found out about the Homeroom program where he can teach something that interests him and the similar idea with students picking a Homeroom course of their liking, he thought technology would be the best way to reach many students and make it a great investment and use of their time. He made an effort to study and do his own research on teaching coding, even without formal training and education. He was able to get training through DonorsChoose on two PDs on Bootstrap and the Beauty and Joy of Computing, aside from the 2-day basic Code.org training. He used DonorsChoose to acquire Arduino kits so students can apply their coding skills and make it come to life. When he started, he only had a little over 10 students, and mostly boys. It grew to almost 35 this year, with mostly all demographics represented,e.g., Hispanic, African-American, Asian, boys, and girls. Their coding class is one of the most sought-after Homeroom course at Emerson and prides itself with students that have gone beyond the courses they learn by enrolling in after-school and summer coding courses. We have a great group of students that take this course very seriously and sparked an interest in pursuing coding further when they grow up. I realized how taking the risk of venturing into the unknown, as long as you have a clear purpose in mind could allow you to accomplish a goal that students benefit a lot from and makes a huge difference in them. They do not only get interested in coding, but they come to school with a lot of excitement, having identified a purpose and a goal that could give them a lifetime of benefits.
