# Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts

<br/>
<br/>
ASMSA has been responsible for providing training to nearly half of Arkansas' newly-licensed computer science teachers via their Coding Arkansas' Future initiative. This year, nearly 1,500 students and teachers in rural communities across the state will benefit from their expertise and support.	

To facilitate these programs, Director Corey Alderdice has worked to secure nearly $2 million in grant funding from the Arkansas Department of Education as well as additional support from groups like Google, Entergy of Arkansas, the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, and individual donors. ASMSA's educator development and mentoring model has been highly successful in building capacity within local districts in order to meet Governor Hutchinson’s bold vision of computer science in every Arkansas high school. To date, the program has worked with nearly 100 educators—both new and experienced—in developing their abilities to teach computer science through a year-long program. They learn from an ASMSA master teacher, who provides course content through blended learning. The local teachers serve in an “on the ground” support role to assist and evaluate students while learning what makes for effective practice within the CS classroom. The school has recently developed and implemented a trial offering of a new CS+E experience for the state’s middle grades “coding block” requirement. The six-week program in computer science and entrepreneurship guides teachers and students through basic coding concepts, mobile applications development, and the Lean Canvas approach to entrepreneurship and problem solving. The experience positions students to enter competitions like the Congressional App Challenge and Apps for Good Festival. ASMSA is the first U.S.-based partner in Apps for Good. The school has worked with the Women’s Foundation of Arkansas to launch #g1rlsc0de enrichment programs and facilitate discussions on equity in access to computer science classes.
