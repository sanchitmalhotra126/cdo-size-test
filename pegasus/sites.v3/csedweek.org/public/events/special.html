      Next Monday, this will change! Venice High School will be one of thousands of schools around the United States hosting The Hour of Code.  In alignment with national Computer Science Education Week, The Hour of Code is “a one-hour introduction to computer science designed to demystify “code” and show that anyone, even teenagers, can learn the basics to be a maker, a creator, an innovator (CSEW, 2013).”  Led by STEMM teachers, students will work on laptops to create their own computer codes. By the end of the hour, students will be able to create their own digital game. Local software developers Joe Daverin (Google) and Oscar Gutierrez (Stauffer) will also be joining Venice’s Hour of Code to lead an advanced group of students to create their own iPhone app.

      STEMM teachers Jessica Gutierrez (science) and Brent Rojo (math) will also be conducting “coding” lessons with in their classrooms throughout the day.

Our principal has approved Thursday, December 12, 2013 as an extended R block where every student in the school participates in the Hour of Code.  Instead of having a guest speaker, each teacher will run an Hour of Code activity for the students.  We are looking forward to the different activities that will be provided for the Hour of Code.  We usually host the community on the Friday of CSEdWeek so the activities from the Hour of Code experience will help with our activities on December 13, 2013.</div>

      On Mondays we have students participate in after school classes called Explorations.  One of our Exploration programs is called Scratch.  It was developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.  Scratch is a programming language based on the Lego brick  building system.  Students can create their own animations, interactive stories, art, and much more. Students are learning mathematical and computational ideas while learning to think creatively and work collaboratively.
      For our one hour workshop I would like to register my Scratch class that will meet on December 9th, the week of Computer Science Education!!  It definitely coincides with the Hour of Code.

The students in my AP computer science class will be taking field trips on the week of December 9 - 15 to different elementary schools in our district to bring an hour of code to elementary school students. Our district currently only has 2 schools that teach programing. Our mission for the week is to make coding fun. Our goal is to help elementary students and teachers get excited about computer programming. Our hope is that our presence will give these students the spark to continue to learn it on their own, take more classes in the future and/or most importantly develop an interest in becoming programmers in the future. We will be posting articles and videos of our week of "CODING Kids" at http://schscreeksquad.blogspot.com/ .</div>

      We are running a contest that involves collecting data and the Hour of Code. Each day during CSEdWeek, students can complete a survey asking them various questions about their academic life and personal life. After each survey, they will receive a bit of HTML. If they can collect all 5 pieces after 5 days of surveys, they can turn those pieces into a small webpage that will take them to our contest entry form. As part of entering the contest they will have to take a screenshot of their Level 20 solution in the Hour of Code beginners' tutorial. We will be awarding one lucky winner in our school with a 7" Kindle Fire HD.

      After the contest has run, we will then take all that data we've collected and use them in our CS courses to generate interesting visualizations of that data. We have over 4000 students in our high school. It should be a pretty robust set of data.

      I am planning on every computer student (half 7th graders and all of the 6th graders) to be in the computer lab with me for a computer event like the blockly demo shown on the website. We will show the introduction and tutorial from youtube to get the students familiar with the lesson and why we are doing it.

      For the students not in my computer lab, we have 2 sets of computer carts and a set of ipads in a cart for entire rooms. For those we can't reach with the computers, we will do the lessons without the computers or do them on smartboards.

      We were flooded in the summer of 2011, so we are just moving (December 2) from our portables to the newly built school, so hopefully everything will go off without a hitch.

      Is your child interested in learning computer programming? If so, please plan to join Computer Club students in the High School Library on December 11th at 6:30 p.m. for the Hour of Code. According to Computer Science Education Week, 2013, Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify "code" and show that anyone can learn the basics of programming to be a maker, a creator, or an innovator.  Schools across the country are encouraged to engage their students in an hour of coding exercises during the week of December 9.

      Our session on December 11 will span two hours from 6:30-8:30. During this time, Computer Club students from the high school will facilitate a variety of self-guided tutorials appropriate for all levels of coders (students in kindergarten – grade 12) from novice to beginner, intermediate and advanced, using a browser, tablet, or smartphone. Guest wireless access will be available so that participants can use their own device, or use a computer available in the school’s library. No experience in programming is needed to attend this activity. There will be food, fun and prizes!  Space is limited, so we encourage you to register your attendance using the following link, http://www.pvhacc.com/hoc/.

      Thank you for your interest!

We use Scratch as our scaffolding of learning and the basis of our computational thinking initiative. Throughout the year students use Scratch, WeDo Robotics, and create e-Textile designs using ModKit. During the three week event, which is built around the CS Hour of Code initiative, students will wear a programmer's badge. As students pass through STEAM Labs, Music, Art, Physical Education, and their regular classes, they will check off the amount of time they were coding in each class. On the reverse side of the card will be listed the computational concepts, practices, and habits of mind. As they learn about loops, sequences, conditionals, debugging, being persistent, and other practices, they will mark it on their badge. In this way we will reinforce the larger concepts of programming while they are creating new projects. In addition, we are hosting a family coding event on December 17, where parents and their children build an animated story or quiz. This event will introduce parents to the importance of programming and provide ideas on how to encourage activities at home.</div>

      Each morning on our North Springs News Show our Video Club will present some facts about computer science, the future of computer science,and careers in computer science, to inform our student body about the importance of learning it.

      We also have 2 activities planned for our school that week. In one Related Arts Rotation (Computer Lab) every K-5 class will have an opportunity to create a holiday card using Scratch. The other Related Arts Rotation (Design Center) every 2-5 Grade class will complete the "My Robotics Friends" activity. This way students have an opportunity to do both a computer activity and non-computer activity. We are excited about this week.

Parents were amazed at the sophisticated computer programming the third, fourth, and fifth grade students were able to create.  At the beginning of the class, most students were novices to the program, and with only, 4 hours of computer time, they were able to change Sprites and backgrounds, add sound and motion, and create a great piece of creative writing which not only persuaded them to buy products from their company store, but in many instances highlighted a clever sense of humor.  SCRATCH /Computer Programming will definitely continue to be an important part of the curriculum in this business unit.

      I'm a teacher at Smithland Elementary School that is very diverse, with a large ESL population.  Over half of our school is free and reduced lunch as well.  I love this idea and I'm trying to get as many kids as I can manage involved in this opportunity for an after school club.  Many of our kids do not have computers or internet at home, and this is an opportunity that I cannot pass up!  I've never done anything like this before, but I'm trying to get my administrator on board because computer science and technology are two of my passions.  To run this as a club I would be teaching more than one week in December.  Would it be possible to gain access to the "hands on" lessons for the week prior to the kick-off so my kids could work with those the first week and then do the computer programming (on computers) the second week that it goes live?

      In our institution, we have planned an event where children and youth will share an hour of programming with his grandparents. We consider that the family is an authentic old school intergenerational relationships.

      The speed of change in knowledge and technology have enabled the phenomenon has been termed "reverse knowledge transfer" ( transmission from children to parents ), that far from being negative , allowing the old cushion the impact that these changes will place in everyday life. At the same time, the old man acts as an element of stability within the family and also as a link between generations and reflection. The value of the elderly is based on the complementarity with the figure of the parents. Indeed grandparents are the nice part of the education of grandchildren.

      In our institution, the premise is learning by doing, and this "game", where children and grandparents interact, will no doubt aimed to show that anyone can learn the basics to be a maker, a creator, an innovator.

      The hour of code (La hora del código)

      La Hora del Código conocida como Computer Science Educational Week, es una iniciativa impulsada por Bill Gates de Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg de Facebook, Stephen Wozniak de Apple, Jack Dorsey de Twitter y muchos más, además con el apoyo de reconocidas personalidades o estrellas del entretenimiento como Will.i.am de The Black Eyed Peas, Chris Bosh NBA All-star, Ashton Kutcher, Enrique Iglesias entre otros.

      La Hora del Código, Es una introducción a la ciencia de la computación, diseñada para desmitificar "el código" y mostrar que cualquier persona puede aprender lo básico para ser un desarrollador, un creador, un innovador.

      El evento busca reunir a más de 10 millones de personas a nivel mundial, entre aficionados, principiantes y tal vez desconocidos al arte de la programación.

I plan to make a EBS online system to provide all services for ebayers and other wholesales. Through this system, they no need to worry about the products, orders,logistics and also finance. They just need to do their job-custom services. Cause i believe custom service  is the most precious part in the whole B2C /C2C business. Just let EBS do the professional things. Seller also need to enjoy their work and life. I'm very interested in network and computer technologies. But i'm new to these plenty of codes. I just know something and can write HTML, CSS, and can make very easy website. But i really need to learn to develop web app. I choose Python.

      Dear Creators of the Hour of Code,

          I am an English teach at Herman Otto Primary School (1149, Budapest, 69 Egressy út). Our principal Mr. Attila Toszegi has brought your great project to my attention. As I have mentioned, I am not Computer Science Teacher, but we (the Computer Science teachers and me) are going to work together to organize your fantastic idea, the Hour of Code, at our school.
          We are planning to have one lesson during the Computer Science Education Week when every student and teacher code. Every student can code at the same time, even if they have their schedule class with their biology, mathematics or P.E. teacher. We have got two computer labs, and some of the classrooms have computers with internet access and an active board. Those who cannot use a computer can do the Hour of Code unplugged.

          Sincerely yours,
          Ms. Gabriella Varnai

      Dear Code.org,

      We are INC resources which is a human resources community in Indonesia who wants to make a change in our country. We currently have 3 groups which involved 100 hard working people. We are generally dominated by young adults around 16 - 28, with some of professionals too, and we have a dream to make a living with technology. We are really interested in leading community members to be teacher to other students, and especially to the world. We have thousand of people in our city itself interested to learn about coding.

      As it is, our organisation is planning to do a local seminary; as what we do best at. Our goal is to come to school, colleges & university to help introduce Code.org to Indonesia.

      We are hoping that we can help people; starting from ourself, surroundings, companies, and others to use more technology among them and we are looking forward to hear a reply from you.

      Sincerely, Timothy Randy

          I am a Computer Science student .
          I am working as an IT system support at NICE SYSTEMS company.
          I would like to volunteer and to make a special event for CS-unplugged on my home town in the elementary school .
          It will be a Computer Science full study and activities day.
          This event is very important for the reason that here in my village the Computer Science Topic still underdeveloped and not getting the full attention at school.
          We have a bright children with no tools and training.
          I really liked the idea of the Computer Science education week.
          The material and the tutorials are so useful.

          I will appreciate if you HighLight this event.
          Ofcourse i will send pictures and movies that document the event.

          Please update me if you need any further information.

      Sir, we are from Pakistan and my university fellows as well as the student affairs department here is good to know from you and planning to organize a coding competition within the university in the hour of code week. In which a C plus plus complex problem needs to be coded and complied within an hour. We talked to them about some resources which they agreed to give on a condition that we must get a chance to have a video conference with the "tec titans". We told them we are pretty sure code.org team will help us in this regard.
      Institute of space technology is having graduating students in different departments like aerospace, mechanical, electrical, material science and space science. All of them have a C++ course in their subjects.
      We have a nice conference room setup here that is often used for international conferences.
      Developing countries like Pakistan has less opportunities like the one you are offering, the exposure to information technology; the real future.
      We really appreciate your support

Then, I presented how to use the tutorials, Angry Bird, and Kahn Academy for Java Script.  Then, to end it the students watched the 14 year old prodigy on Thinkr-Santiago.  It was amazing!  The energy was fantastic!  Thank you so much for creating this campaign.  Even the teachers were excited to give it a try.  One more thing that we didn't even realize, even though women represent 18% of the computer industry...we were all women up there presenting to the kids.  Very powerful as one colleague mentioned.  All week students will be learning code using various tutorials from all levels.  We have a one to one laptop program in the middle/high school and laptop stations in the elementary.  We all wish to give it a try.
      Regards,
      Janice (Middle/high school science teacher/Head of Science Dept.)
