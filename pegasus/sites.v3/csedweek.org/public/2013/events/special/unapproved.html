      Program yourself a great week at The Tech!

              As part of Code.org’s Hour of Code for CSEdWeek, guests can do drag-and-drop programming with Google Blockly and Blockly Turtle Graphics to solve maze games and create their own digital art, or they can go unplugged and program a human robot with our Tech staff and other robot-programming guests.

              We'll also be partnering with programming-focused partners like Google and Play-i to lead programming stations and prototype their technology with guests.

              We’ll expose guests to different ways to learn programming, with stations set up throughout the lower level. From learning to code with visual programming languages to mastering games, making cool designs, and programming robots to do playful tasks, guests will start to think like programmers as they break down complex problems into logical steps and leverage their own creativity to make technology do whatever they want.

              Guests will get to learn programming directly from Google volunteers and the founders of Play-i, a very successfully crowd-funded robot company that makes computer programming fun and accessible through a robot that teaches the logic behind programming in a hands-on, experiential way. The founders are a team of designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs from Apple, Google, and frog design.

              Schedule for CSEdWeek at The Tech:

              Monday – Friday

              10:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m
              Program your way through Blockly maze puzzles with Google volunteers.

              10:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m.
              Program a xylophone-playing robot with Play-i founders.

              12:00–2:00 p.m.
              Program a human robot with Tech staff and other guests.

              9:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.
              Program your own digital art with Blockly Turtle Graphics.

              Saturday & Sunday

              1:00 – 4:00 p.m.
              Program your way through Blockly maze puzzles with Google volunteers.
              Program a xylophone-playing robot with Play-i founders.
              Program a human robot with Tech staff and other guests.

              9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
              Program your own digital art with Blockly Turtle Graphics

              Blockly station
              Located in The Tech Studio
              Self-guided puzzles that teach the basics of computer science are great for guests with no programming experience. In each puzzle, guests write a program that gets a character through a maze. They’ll use Blockly, a visual programming language that has blocks that they drag and drop to write programs. As they use blocks to write code, guests will be able to see the code they write represented in Javascript, a text-based language. There are short videos featuring computer science celebrities Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerbuerg, and the maze puzzles have been designed with characters from the games Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies.

              The puzzles align with educational standards from Common Core, NGSS, and CSTA. Code.org designed these puzzles not only to teach basic computer science concepts, including repeat-loops, conditionals, and basic algorithms, but also to have guests see that computer science is fun, approachable, and relevant to their lives.

              Blockly Turtle Graphics station
              Located in Play.net
              Guests build on their experience at the Blockly station as they use the same visual drag and drop programming language they used to solve the maze puzzles, but now they’ll have even more Blocky command blocks to choose from as they create their own digital masterpieces.

              Play-i Robot Programming station
              Located outside the Social Robots exhibit
              Guests learn to program a robot to play the xylophone with the founders of Play-i, a new robot company that makes computer programming fun and accessible through a robot that teaches the logic behind programming in a hands-on, experiential way.

              Program a Human Robot station
              Located outside the Social Robots exhibit
              Guests program a human robot with Tech staff and other robot-programming guests. They’ll learn to move the robot with various commands to make it do any tasks they want, and then they’ll become the robot as they let other guests program them!

           The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History and Trinity Valley School have recently formed a Design Scientist Program, a collaborative venture to foster digital learning and hands-on experience with technology.  With the upcoming Hour of Code during Computer Science Education week, the two groups have planned most excellent activities to introduce people to code and encourage current coders to grow.


      Following are activities that The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History will host with Trinity Valley students and teachers in recognition of the Hour of Code on Saturday, December 14, 2013:

      •	The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History with offer coding experiences for students in elementary and middle grades via iPad instruction.  Trinity Valley teachers and students will lead these morning and afternoon sessions.  Parents of the elementary and middle school aged students will be invited to participate, as well.
      •	The Fort Museum of Science and History will offer code classes to students in high schools in the Fort Worth area.  They will learn how to code using Processing.  A morning and afternoon class will be offered.

      Following are activities that Trinity Valley School will host involving the Hour of Code:
      •	All Kindergarteners through 6th graders (304 students) will participate in the “Traveling Circuits-Cup Stacking” activity in their hour-long physical education classes on December 11, 2013.  P.E. teachers will be trained to lead this coding experience.
      •	The Trinity Valley School Lower School instructional Specialist will hold coding sessions for lower school students throughout the day on December 11, 2013.
      •	The Trinity Valley fifth and sixth grade mathematics teachers will hold coding sessions for all for all fifth and sixth grade students (147 students) throughout the day on December 9, 2013.
      •	During lower, middle, and upper school lunch periods on December 11, 2013, students from sixth grade through twelfth grade will be chosen to perform for 15 minute time period slots on the “Platform of Coding” and wear the “Coding Crown” during lunch.  The selected student will code and have his/her code and output projected on a large screen in the cafeteria.   All the other students will see students coding in action.
      •	The Trinity Valley School Upper School digital images and AP Computer Sciences will be coding throughout the day.  Two computer labs will be open for all TVS students to learn to code.  The computer science students and computer science teachers will aid those wanting to learn to code.

As part of our commitment, all of our Engineers gave one day of their time to teach this kids about Computer Science Basics.  The most important challenge we had was to define the contents and curriculum to be taught.  Our conclusion at the end of the exercise was that we needed to teach them something that they won't learn at school, and that was coding.  As we're an Open Source Consulting company, We're able to show them some of the code of the same programs  they were using.  That was allucinating for these kids and for us.  Once I learnt about your program I knew that something like that is what we need. Because of this we want to participate and emulate your initiative as part of our Social Responsability program at SEAQ.</div>

      Students between the ages of 10 and 16 enrolled in grades 4 through 9 will choose to take part in any of three coding challenge categories using either Scratch or Alice.  Students and their teachers will participate in representation of their schools. A set number of students and teachers (approximately 190) will do the Hour of Code event at the Foundation´s facilities in San Jose, many more will also solve the event´s coding challenges virtually from their schools, and the event will be shared and broadcasted widely to thousands of students in more than 1,600 schools currently participating in the Program nationwide.

          Special prizes for participating students will be awarded and their schools will get a Program-issued certificate of participation. Worldwide eligible prizes for teachers (Dropbox storage gift) will be arranged with csedweek.org.
