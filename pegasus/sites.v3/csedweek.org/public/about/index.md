# About

Computer Science Education Week (CSEdWeek) is an annual program dedicated to inspiring K-12 students to take interest in computer science.

Originally conceived by the Computing in the Core coalition, Code.org&reg; is producing CSEdWeek for the first time this year, held in recognition of the birthday of computing pioneer [Admiral Grace Murray Hopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) (December 9, 1906).

## Code.org&reg;

[Code.org](http://code.org/) is a non-profit dedicated to expanding computer science education. The Code.org vision is that computer science should be part of the core curriculum in every school, alongside other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, such as biology, physics, chemistry and algebra.
