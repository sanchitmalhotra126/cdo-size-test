## The fine print:
No previous coding experience is needed!!! Anyone can do this. In fact, the less coding experience you have, the better.

Please submit the video before Nov 20.

We encourage you to be creative with the video! Film in an interesting place. Find an interesting way to show the computer or tablet that you used to do the Hour of Code.

Also, please use your native language, whatever it might be (English, Chinese, Spanish, etc). We want to showcase that this is a global movement, with people trying the Hour of Code from around the world.

Please film in landscape mode (holding your camera sideways) instead of portrait mode (holding your camera vertically).

## Sample script:
My name is _______ and I’m doing the Hour of Code.

I finished level X, and I’ve written Y lines of code.

[Now say whatever else you’d like]

## Questions?
