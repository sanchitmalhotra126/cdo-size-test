*For all press and media inquiries, contact <press@code.org>*

### Sfaturi utile

  * Luați legătura cu mass-media prin e-mail cu doua săptamâni inainte de eveniment .
  * Adresați-vă unui membru al personalului școlii sau unui voluntar pentru a face fotografii pentru distribuire online sau trimitere catre presă.
  * Scrieți despre evenimentul Hour of Code pe prima pagină a site-ului dvs. și în ziarul școlii. Trimiteți detaliile despre eveniment și imagini cu activitățile studenților.
  * Pe Facebook sau Twitter, distribuie noutati privind planurile tale, anunta evenimentele si posteaza fotografii din timpul saptamanii 7-13 decembrie. Foloseste hashtag-ul **#HourOfCode**astfel incat Code.org iti poate vedea fotografiile si promova evenimentul.

### Ghid pas cu pas:

**1. Plan your event**

  * Planifică o întâlnire pentru a începe evenimentul.
  * Trimite-le[o scrisoare](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>)parintilor. Spune-le sa raspandeasca vestea.
  * Trimite-le [o scrisoare](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>) pentru a-i invita pe primarul orasului, congresmanul, guvernatorul sau persoanele influente din business pentru a lua parte la evenimentul tau si pentru a le vorbi elevilor.
  * Organizează activităţi de grup (cum ar fi o demonstraţie de activitate de programare "unplugged"), sau prezentați activităţi create şi conduse de elevi.
  * Arata-le vide-ul[Hour of Code al Code.org](<%= resolve_url('/') %>)sau unul dintre[acestea](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#videos') %>)pentru a-i inspira.

**2. Identify specific local reporters that cover education or local events.**

Think a local newspaper, TV station, radio station or blog.

Look online to find reporter contact information. If you can't find it, call the publication to ask, or email a general tips@PUBLICATIONNAME.com email address and ask for your message to be directed to the correct reporter.

**3. Contact local media**

The best way to reach out is by email. It should be short and communicate: why should other people care about this event? Include contact information (including a cellphone number) for who will be on site at the event. **See a [sample pitch to media](<%= resolve_url('/promote/resources#sample-emails') %>).**

**4. Prepare to field questions about your school event. Here are some examples:**

*Why is your school doing an Hour of Code?*

While all of us know that it’s important for students to learn how to navigate today’s tech-saturated world, many teachers aren’t experienced in computer science and don’t know where to start. This event is a chance for all of us to see what computer science is about.

We hope it’ll spark interest in students to keep learning. Research also shows that kids can pick up programming concepts before they know how to read and write. In fact, their brains are more receptive to computer languages at a young age, just like foreign languages.

*Why is this important?*

Technology is transforming every industry on the planet. In 2015, 7 million openings in the U.S. were in occupations—including art and design—that value coding skills. But 75 percent of schools in the U.S. don't teach computer science. It’s time for us to catch up to the 21st century. We know that regardless of what our students do when they grow up, whether they go into medicine, business, politics, or the arts, knowing how to build technology will give them confidence and a competitive edge.
