# How to bring the Hour of Code to your company
There are many ways companies can participate in the Hour of Code and help expand participation in computer science. Consider:

- Asking your CEO to send a company-wide email emphasizing the importance of computer science and encouraging employees to spread the word. See this email.

- Hosting an Hour of Code Happy Hour with coworkers to try the tutorials

- Inviting a local classroom of students or other non profits you partner with to do an Hour of Code at your companyâ€™s office.

- Visiting a local classroom to help lead an Hour of Code and inspire students to study computer science. We invite software engineers to sign up as an inspiration speaker. (link to volunteer signup form).
