# How To Guide for Hour of Code Volunteers
## 1. Sign up to volunteer
Visit a local classroom to inspire students to keep learning computer science. [Volunteer for an hour](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer).

## 2. Join a Volunteer Training webinar
These webinars will be hosted via Hangouts on Air, so if you miss it you can still catch the recorded session later.

| Date | Time |
|------------ | ------------- |
|November 16 | 1:00pm - 1:30pm PST|
|December 3 | 11:00am - 11:30am PST|

## 3. Spend 30 minutes trying the tutorials beforehand
Try the Hour of Code tutorials at [code.org/learn](https://code.org/learn).  Pick a few of the most popular tutorials and spend some time to get familiar with each of them. It will take you about 5-10 minutes per tutorial to get a sense of how it works.

## 4. Recruit your co-workers to volunteer
Tell your friends and co-workers about the Hour of Code. We have thousands of teachers signing up and looking for volunteer engineers, so ask them to [sign up as a volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer).

**Sample email:**

Inspire students to keep learning beyond one Hour of Code. 

Sign up to volunteer with a classroom doing the Hour of Code. Visit a classroom or school assembly in person or join students via video call--your choice! 

How it works: Fill out [this form](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer) to let teachers know your background and how you'd like to participate. Educators can find available volunteers in their area and contact them using a secure form.

## 5. Ask your employer to get involved
[Send this email](https://hourofcode.com/resources#email) to your manager, or the CEO.

## 6. Promote the Hour of Code in your community
Recruit a local group â€” boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group or labor union. Or host an Hour of Code "block party" for your neighborhood. [Send this email](https://hourofcode.com/resources#email).

## 7. Read the suggested agenda below so you know what to expect when you visit a classroom.

# Agenda for Volunteering in a Classroom

### 1. Sign into the school and greet the teacher. Confirm the agreed schedule and discuss any talking points.

### 2. Spend 5-10 minutes talking about computer science: how it impacted you personally and how it has broad, worldwide impact. Answer any questions from students.

### 3. Play the [Hour of Code video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxWIxec6yo)

### 4. Let the students dive into the tutorials. Walk around the classroom answering any questions and guiding them through tough puzzles. Try not to give students the solution outright, instead try asking them questions so they can answer themselves what went wrong.
