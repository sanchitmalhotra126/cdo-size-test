# Blurbs and Useful Stats

## Some shocking statistics (USA)

  * There will be one million more computing jobs than students over the next 10 years (adding up to $500 billion in salaries).
  * More than 50 percent of all projected math and science occupations are in computing occupations. 
  * Computing occupations are among the highest-paying jobs for new graduates. Yet fewer than 3% of college students graduate with a degree in computer science.
  * In 25 states, computer science classes don’t count toward math or science high school graduation requirements. 
  * Less than 20% of AP Computer Science students are women. Less than 10% are black or Latino.

### Bring computer science to your school. Start with an Hour of Code 
Computers are everywhere, but fewer schools teach computer science than 10 years ago. Good news is, we’re on our way to change this. If you heard about the <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/') %>">Hour of Code</a> last year, you might know it made history. In one week, 15 million students tried computer science! The <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/') %>">Hour of Code</a> is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/') %>">Sign up</a> to host an Hour of Code this December 8-14 during Computer Science Education Week and help reach 100 million students by the end of the year. If you did this last year, you know that students loved it. Try to go even bigger, get every student at your school participating. We’ll have new tutorials for all ages and ones that require no computer at all. Watch the <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/') %>">video</a>, and ask all educators to give it a shot. Every participating educator will receive <a href="<%= hoc_uri('/us/prizes') %>">thank you gifts</a>. 96 classrooms will win tech chats with special guest speakers. And in each state, one participating school will win $10,000 in technology for their school! Add your school to the map, go to <http://hourofcode.com>
