# This script reshapes survey data collected via Jotform into a form more accessible for analysis.

#   currently stores value of submission (e.g., 7 for "strongly agree")
#   doesn't process data for facilitator-specific questions
#   doesn't process other places where we're collecting jotform data (e.g., PostCourseSurvey for teachers)
#   create tables to store this information permanently
