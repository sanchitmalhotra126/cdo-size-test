# This script normalizes values in the `gender` column of the `users` table to
# be one of NULL (unspecified), "-" (decline to answer), "f" (female), or "m"
# (male). Any existing value that is not one of these four is set to NULL.
#
# As of 2016-05-23, there were approximately 727886 such users in production.
#
# This is being done as a one-off script so as to be able to control the timing
# of its execution in production, followed by a migration performing the same
# task so as to assure good data in all environments.
