# This script destroys sections and followers of deleted users, making the integration of the
# paranoia gem backwards compatible.

# NOTE: Throughout, we would prefer to call `my_model.destroy` rather than
# `my_model.update!(deleted_at: my_timestamp)`. Unfortunately, the paranoia gem does not offer
# control of the timestamp, so we thus need to resort to updating the deleted_at column and
# executing the dependent destroys manually.
# See https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia/issues/403 for this feature request.

# NOTE: As this script can be safely run multiple times, we use `update!` rather than `update` or
# `save(validate: false)` for visibility of models not passing our validations.
