# Premi - Termini e condizioni di partecipazione

## Spazio su Dropbox o credito Skype:

I 10 GB di spazio su Dropbox o i 10$ di credito Skype sono riservati a studenti di scuole elementari, medie o superiori, educatori di sostegno e agenzie educative. The 10 GB of free space must be added to an existing Dropbox account. Limit one redemption per organizer.

Every organizer must register for the Hour of Code in order to receive the Dropbox space or Skype credit. If your entire school participates in the Hour of Code, each educator must individually register as an organizer to qualify.
