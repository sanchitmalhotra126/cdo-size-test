# Ghidul pentru voluntari

## 1. Inscrie-te pentru a fi voluntar

Visit a local classroom to inspire students to keep learning computer science. [Volunteer for an hour](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer).

## Alătură-te unei sesiuni de informare a voluntarilor

We'll be hosting two info sessions to explain what a typical volunteer experience will be like. We'll discuss how to coordinate with teachers before their Hour of Code event and also what you should do the day of the event to prepare. Please come with your questions! These info sessions will be hosted via Hangouts on Air, so if you miss it you can still catch the recorded session later. [See the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2PjgICSEnYGTD7MT1mvLS6RvA9BJDG4zWheD0ZFIUo/edit?usp=sharing).

## 3. Incercati tutorialele cu 30 de minute inainte

Try the Hour of Code tutorials at [code.org/learn](https://code.org/learn). Pick a few of the most popular tutorials and spend some time to get familiar with each of them. It will take you about 5-10 minutes per tutorial to get a sense of how it works.

## 4. Recruteaza-ti colegii sa fie voluntari

Tell your friends and co-workers about the Hour of Code. We have thousands of teachers signing up and looking for volunteers, so ask them to [sign up as a volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer).

**Sample email:**

**Subject line**: Join me in volunteering for the Hour of Code

If you remember your very first line of code, you know it shaped the rest of your life.

That’s what the Hour of Code is all about. In the last three years, the movement has shattered stereotypes in tech and helped more than 100 million students in 180 countries try computer science for the first time.

**I signed up to volunteer in a local classroom, and you can, too!**   
Code.org is matching classrooms with technical volunteers like you who can help students and teachers through their first Hour of Code.

Please [volunteer for an hour](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer). After you sign up, local teachers will be able to contact you for help using a secure form.

Can’t volunteer? [Help spread the word about the Hour of Code instead!](https://hourofcode.com/promote).

**Your experience matters**  
Most schools still don’t teach computer science. Most students don’t know that coding is about solving big problems and connecting people. This is a chance to inspire at least one young person in your area.

**[Sign up to volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer)**

*Your email address will never be shared with teachers.

## 5. Solicită angajatorului să se implice

[Send this email](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#email) to your manager, or the CEO.

## 4. Promoveaza Hour of Code în comunitatea ta

Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group or labor union. Or host an Hour of Code "block party" for your neighborhood. [Send this email](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#email).

## 7. Pregătește-te înainte de a vizita o clasă.

Review a typical agenda below, and [review these tips](https://code.org/files/CSTT_Volunteers.pdf) about how to connect with students during your visit.

# Ordinea de zi pentru voluntariat în sala de clasă

### 1. Intra in scoala si saluta profesorul. Confirma programul convenit si discutati despre subiectele de predare.

### 2. Aduceti lucruri de la compania dvs cum ar fi abtipilduri. Copiii iubesc toate lucrurile cu care pot interactiona.

### 3. Vorbeste 5-10 minute despre tehnologia computer-ului si programare: ce impact personal a avut asupra ta si ce impact are asupra lumii intregi. Raspunde la orice intrebare de la elevi.

### 4. Ruleaza [Video-ul Hour of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxWIxec6yo)

### 5. Lasa elevii sa inceapa tutorialele. Plimba-te prin casa si raspunde la intrebari ghidandu-i prin puzzle-uri. Incearca sa nu le dai elevilor direct solutia. In schimb, incearca sa le pui intrebari pentru ca ei sa raspunda singuri si sa isi dea seama ce nu a functionat corect.
