# Retningslinjer for gjennomganger (tutorials) i Kodetimen og IT-utdanningsuka

Code.org arrangerer en rekke Kodetime-aktiviteter på nettsidene code.org, hourofcode.com og CSEdWeek.org. Oppdatert liste finnes på [code.org/learn](http://code.org/learn).

Vi ønsker å kunne tilby flere forskjellige engasjerende muligheter, men hovedmålet er en best mulig opplevelse for elever og lærere som ikke kan så mye om IT. Bruk dette dokumentet som en veiledning når du lager en aktivitet som er rettet mot brukere som ikke har bakgrunn innenfor koding, programmering eller IT.

## Hvordan en gjennomgang vil bli vurdert for inkludering

En komité av IT-lærere vil rangere innleveringer basert på kvalitative og kvantitative kriterier, inkludert resultater fra spørreundersøkelser hos et bredere utvalg lærere.

**Gjennomganger rangeres høyere hvis de:**

  * har høy kvalitet
  * er selvstyrt, trenger ikke instruksjoner
  * er utformet for nybegynnere
  * er utformet som en ~ 1 time aktivitet
  * virker på tvers av operativsystemer/plattformer, inkludert mobil og nettbrett
  * virker på tvers av språk
  * fremmer læring innenfor alle demografiske grupper (spesielt underrepresenterte grupper)
  * ikke bare fokuserer på HTML+CSS web design (målet vårt er IT, ikke bare HTML-koding)

**Gjennomganger rangeres lavere hvis de:**

  * har lavere kvalitet
  * mer avansert læringsnivå (ikke for nybegynnere)
  * har et begrenset antall støttede operativsystemer/plattformer - for nettbaserte plattformer bør følgende støttes: IE9+ og nyeste Chrome, Firefox og Safari
  * virker kun på engelsk
  * har en kjønnsspesifikk tendens (f.eks tematikk primært rettet mot gutter)
  * tjener som innsalg for en læringsplattform som tar betalt for undervisning

**Gjennomganger vil IKKE inkluderes hvis de:**

  * krever mye instruksjon av lærer/mye forberedelse (dvs. ikke selvstudium for elever)
  * er ikke utformet for å være (omtrent) én times aktivitet
  * krever registrering 
  * krever betaling
  * krever installasjon
  * kun fokuserer på HTML+CSS webdesign
  * sendes inn etter fristen eller med ufullstendig informasjon (se nedenfor)

Målet med Kodetimen-kampanjen å få flere lærere og elever til å jobbe med IT, og å vise at IT er tilgjengelig for alle og "lettere enn du tror." Dette målet oppnås lettere ved å gi elever og lærere færre og enklere valg, med fokus på alternativer med høy kvalitet for nybegynneren.

Merk også at IT-utdanningsuka 2013 (CSEdWeek) var en fantastisk suksess målt etter svarene fra lærere og elever - 20 mill deltakere mellom 9-23 desember, og 97% sa de likte det og vil gjenta kampanjen!!

Gjennomgangene som finnes allerede (på engelsk) er absolutt "gode nok", og det er ikke lite utvalg som er årsaken til at vi ønsker flere gjennomganger. Det er derimot å heve kvaliteten (eller aktualitet) for elever, og å få flere valg for ikke-engelskspråklige brukere sett i lys av den globale karakteren for 2014-kampanjen.

<a id="guidelines"></a>

## Generelle retningslinjer for å opprette en Kodetime-aktivitet

  * **Subject:** Introductory computer science or programming (not HTML).
  * **Goal:** Give beginners an accessible first taste of programming.
  * **Tone:** 
      * Computer science is not just for geniuses. It doesn’t matter your age, gender, race. Anybody can learn!
      * Computer science is connected to a wide variety of fields and interests. Everybody should learn!
      * Encourage students to create something that can be shared with friends/online.
  * **Types of activities:** 
      * **Best:** Web-based, smartphone-friendly, or unplugged-style activities that teach computer science concepts without the use of a computer (see <http://csunplugged.com/>). 
      * **Okay, but not preferred:** app-install, desktop app, or game-console experiences.
  * **Format:** Self-guided tutorials or lessons, optionally facilitated by the teacher. There should be directions for students as opposed to an open-ended hour long challenge. Ideally, the instructions and tutorials are integrated directly into the programming platform, to avoid switching tabs or windows between the tutorial and the programming platform.

## Forslag til utforming av din aktivitet

**Include the CSEdWeek logo in your tutorial.** You can include the CSEdWeek logo ([small](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ojlltuegr7ruvx1/csedweek-logo-final-small.jpg) or [big](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yolheibpxapzpp1/csedweek-logo-final-big.png)) in your tutorial, but this is not required. You may also contact us to request specific permission to use the “In Partnership with Code.org” logo. ***This logo can only be used if specific permission is granted in writing by Code.org.*** We may end up creating an Hour of Code logo, but at this time we do not have one. Under no circumstances can the Code.org logo and name be used. Both are trademarked, and can’t be co-mingled with a 3rd party brand name.

**Make sure that the average student can finish comfortably in an hour.** Consider adding an open-ended activity at the end for students who move more quickly through the lesson. Remember that most kids will be absolute beginners to computer science and coding.

**Include teacher notes.** Most activities should be student-directed, but if an activity is facilitated or managed by a teacher, please include clear and simple directions for the teacher in the form of teacher-notes at a separate URL submitted with your activity. Not only are the students novices, some of the teachers are as well. Include info such as:

  * Our tutorial works best on the following platforms and browsers
  * Does it work on smartphones? tablets?
  * Do you recommend pair programming? 
  * Considerations for use in a classroom? eg if there are videos, advise teachers to show the videos on a projected screen for the entire classroom to view together

**Incorporate feedback at the end of the activity.** (E.g.: “You finished 10 levels and learned about loops! Great job!”)

**Incorporate social media.** Encourage students to post to social media (where appropriate) when they’ve finished, for example “I’ve done an Hour of Code with ________ Have you? #HourOfCode” or “I’ve done an #HourofCode as a part of #CSEdWeek. Have you? @Scratch.” Use the hashtag **#HourOfCode** (with capital letters H, O, C)

**Create your activity in languages besides English.** We're focusing this campaign internationally this year and would like to have a number of activities to offer non-English speaking participants.

**Explain or connect the activity to a socially significant context.** Computer programming becomes a superpower when students see how it can change the world for the better!

**Do not require signup or payment before students can try your tutorial.** Tutorials that require signup or payment will not be listed

**Make sure your tutorial can be used in a [Pair Programming paradigm](http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning).**

The three rules of pair programming in a school setting:

  * The driver controls the mouse and keyboard.
  * The Navigator makes suggestions, points out errors, and asks questions. 
  * Students should switch roles at least two times a session.

Benefits of Pair Programming:

  * Students can help one another instead of relying on the teacher
  * Show that coding is not a solo activity, but one involving social interaction
  * Not all classrooms or labs have enough computers for a 1:1 experience

## Retningslinjer for varemerker

With ~40 million students having tried the Hour of Code, and over 97% of participating teachers asking us to repeat the event annually, we are taking steps to make sure we set up the Hour of Code as a movement that can repeat annually with greater fidelity and without confusion.

One piece of this is to protect the trademark "Hour of Code" to prevent confusion. Many of our tutorial partners have used "Hour of Code" on your web sites. We don't want to prevent this usage, but we want to make sure it fits within a few limits:

  1. Any reference to "Hour of Code" should be used in a fashion that doesn't suggest that it's your own brand name, but rather referencing the Hour of Code as a grassroots movement. Good example: "Participate in the Hour of Code at ACMECorp.com". Bad example: "Try Hour of Code by ACME Corp"
  2. Use a "TM" superscript in the most prominent places you mention "Hour of Code", both on your web site and in app descriptions
  3. Include language on the page (or in the the footer), including links to the CSEdWeek and Code.org web sites, that says the following:
    
    ***“The 'Hour of Code' is a nationwide initiative by Computer Science Education Week[csedweek.org] and Code.org [code.org] to introduce millions of students to one hour of computer science and computer programming.”***

  4. No use of "Hour of Code" in app names

## Sporingspiksel

In order to more accurately track participation we ask every third party tutorial partners to include 1-pixel tracking images on the first and last page of their Hour of Code tutorials (A starting pixel-image on the start page and a final pixel-image on the end page. And not on interim pages).

This will allow us to count users who you directly recruit to visit your website to do their Hour of Code, or users who visit when a teacher types your URL directly on their whiteboard. It will lead to more accurate participation counts for your tutorial, which will help you attract users. If you integrate the pixel at the end it will also allow us to measure tutorial completion rates.

If your tutorial is approved and included on the final tutorial page, Code.org will provide you with a unique tracking pixel for you to integrate into your tutorial. See example below.

***NOTE: this isn't important to do for installable apps (iOS/Android apps, or desktop-install apps)***

**Example tracking pixels for AppInventor:**

IMG SRC="http://code.org/api/hour/begin_appinventor.png/"

IMG SRC="http://code.org/api/hour/finish_appinventor.png/"

<a id="promote"></a>

## Markedsføre dine gjennomganger, IT-utdanningsuka og Kodetimen

We are asking everyone to promote their own 1-hour tutorial to your users. Please direct them to your Hour of Code page. Your users are much more likely to react to a mailing from you about your tutorial. Use the international Hour of Code campaign for Computer Science Education Week as an excuse to encourage users to invite others to join in, help us reach 100 million total participants.

  * Feature Hour of Code and CSEdWeek on your website.  
    Ex: <http://www.tynker.com/hour-of-code>
  * Promote Hour of Code using social media, traditional media, mailing lists, etc, using hashtag **#HourOfCode** (with capital letters H, O, C)
  * Host a local event or ask your employees to host an event at local schools or community groups.
  * See our resource kit for further information (coming soon).

## A special note for students with disabilities

If you create a tutorial that is designed for the vision-impaired, we’d love to highlight it for viewers with screen-readers. We have not yet received such a tutorial, and would be eager to include one as an option for these students.
