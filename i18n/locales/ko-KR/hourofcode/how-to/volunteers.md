# 자원봉사자를 위한 How-to 가이드

## 1. 자원봉사자로 등록하세요.

Visit a local classroom to inspire students to keep learning computer science. [Volunteer for an hour](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer).

## 2. 자원 봉사 정보 세션에 참가하세요.

We'll be hosting two info sessions to explain what a typical volunteer experience will be like. We'll discuss how to coordinate with teachers before their Hour of Code event and also what you should do the day of the event to prepare. Please come with your questions! These info sessions will be hosted via Hangouts on Air, so if you miss it you can still catch the recorded session later. [See the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2PjgICSEnYGTD7MT1mvLS6RvA9BJDG4zWheD0ZFIUo/edit?usp=sharing).

## 3. 사전에 30분동안 튜토리얼을 해보세요.

Try the Hour of Code tutorials at [code.org/learn](https://code.org/learn). Pick a few of the most popular tutorials and spend some time to get familiar with each of them. It will take you about 5-10 minutes per tutorial to get a sense of how it works.

## 4. 자원봉사를 할 동료를 모집하세요.

Tell your friends and co-workers about the Hour of Code. We have thousands of teachers signing up and looking for volunteers, so ask them to [sign up as a volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer).

**Sample email:**

**Subject line**: Join me in volunteering for the Hour of Code

If you remember your very first line of code, you know it shaped the rest of your life.

That’s what the Hour of Code is all about. In the last three years, the movement has shattered stereotypes in tech and helped more than 100 million students in 180 countries try computer science for the first time.

**I signed up to volunteer in a local classroom, and you can, too!**   
Code.org is matching classrooms with technical volunteers like you who can help students and teachers through their first Hour of Code.

Please [volunteer for an hour](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer). After you sign up, local teachers will be able to contact you for help using a secure form.

Can’t volunteer? [Help spread the word about the Hour of Code instead!](https://hourofcode.com/promote).

**Your experience matters**  
Most schools still don’t teach computer science. Most students don’t know that coding is about solving big problems and connecting people. This is a chance to inspire at least one young person in your area.

**[Sign up to volunteer](https://code.org/volunteer/engineer)**

*Your email address will never be shared with teachers.

## 5. 여러분의 직장 상사에게 함께 참여하도록 요청해 보세요.

[Send this email](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#email) to your manager, or the CEO.

## 6. 여러분의 지역사회에 Hour of Code를 홍보하세요.

Recruit a local group — boy/girl scouts club, church, university, veterans group or labor union. Or host an Hour of Code "block party" for your neighborhood. [Send this email](https://hourofcode.com/promote/resources#email).

## 7. 교실 수업에 들어가기 전에 준비하세요.

Review a typical agenda below, and [review these tips](https://code.org/files/CSTT_Volunteers.pdf) about how to connect with students during your visit.

# 교실 자원봉사에 관한 의제

### 1. 학교에 등록하고 선생님을 만나세요. 합의한 일정을 확인하고 화두에 대해 논의하세요.

### 2. 여러분 회사에서 스티커와 같은 물품을 가져오세요. 어린이들은 상호작용할 수 있는 어느 것이든 좋아합니다.

### 3. 컴퓨터과학에 대해 5-10분 정도 이야기해 주세요: 여러분 개인적으로 그것이 어떻게 영향을 미쳤는지 그리고 어떻게 광범위한 전세계적인 영향을 미쳤는지. 학생들의 질문에 대답해 주세요.

### 4. [Hour of Code 동영상](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxWIxec6yo)을 보여주세요.

### 5. 학생들이 튜토리얼에 뛰어들게 해 주세요. 질문에 대답하고 어려운 퍼즐을 통해 안내하며 교실을 돌아다니세요. 학생들에게 즉각적으로 해답을 주지 마세요. 대신 무엇이 잘못되었는지 그들 스스로 대답할 수 있도록 질문을 해 주세요.
