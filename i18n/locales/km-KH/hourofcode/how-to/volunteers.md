Computational thinking helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity. And technology is transforming every industry on the planet. Students today should learn how to create technology, not just use it.

The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science designed to demystify “code,” show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. You can help raise awareness of the computer science movement and volunteer to inspire more students to try computer science, particularly young women and students from historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups.

## Who can volunteer?

Anyone passionate about computer science education and increasing diversity in tech can be a volunteer! We’d love to see volunteers of all backgrounds participate. The Hour of Code features a large variety of activities for all ages and skill levels, so you don’t need to be a programming expert to volunteer!

You can be a guest speaker in a classroom, or help a teacher run the activity. [Sign up today](https://code.org/volunteer) to inspire students to keep learning computer science.

<a id="why-volunteer"></a>

## Why volunteer?

Computer science is the defining field of the 21st century, yet most schools still don’t teach it. One Hour of Code may be the most access to computer science that these students receive in a given year. By volunteering, you can make it even easier for teachers to bring CS into their classroom.

Check out some testimonials from past volunteers:

- “The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. It bodes well for the future of our industry to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.” 
- “Especially enjoyed getting to encourage young girls in technology. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.” 
- “ ខ្ញុំសប្បាយចិត្តណាស់ដែលឃើញក្មេងៗរំភើបរីករាយ។ One amazing thing was that the teachers noticed that some of the students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling at thinking like a developer and helping others - giving them a place to feel confident.”

<a id="selection"></a>

## How do volunteers get selected?

Teachers can search for volunteers on our [volunteer map](http://code.org/volunteer/local). If you’re located near their classroom, teachers will review your profile on the map, so try to complete as much as possible to increase the chance that a teacher will contact you.

[![](/images/fit-600/Marketing/2018_HoC-489-resized.jpg)]({{ urls/learn }})

When selected, a teacher will contact you through the volunteer platform (we will never share your email address with the teacher). Work with them to determine how you can best contribute to their event, and if you’ll be visiting in-person or volunteering virtually.

If you are receiving too many requests from teachers, you can always update your preferences or unsubscribe by clicking the link provided at the bottom of any email request from a teacher.

<a id="choose-a-school"></a>

## What if I want to volunteer with a specific school?

You don’t have to use our volunteer map in order to volunteer! In fact, we recommend reaching out to teachers and administrators directly if there’s a classroom you’d like to volunteer with.

To get started: - If you’re a parent or guardian, send [this email](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources#help-schools) to your child’s teacher offering to help them run an Hour of Code. - If you have another school in mind, visit their website to find appropriate contacts to reach out to such as a principal or vice principal, technology or computer science instructors, or even the school’s PTSA. You could also partner with organizations such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Junior Achievement, a YMCA branch, and more to co-host an event. - If you’re unable to find a school that is hosting an Hour of Code, you can volunteer to help run your own event with your company. Check out our [How-To Guide for Companies](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/companies) to learn more and get inspired.

<a id="how-to-prepare"></a>

## How to prepare

Whether you’re attending an Hour of Code event remotely or in-person, you’ll have a much smoother experience if you make these preparations beforehand.

[![](/images/fit-600/Marketing/4Q9A5575.jpg)]({{ urls/learn }})

### Meet with the Organizer

If you’re volunteering with a classroom, discuss these logistics with the teacher ahead of time:

- Your role at the event. If you work in tech, you might be asked to share your personal experiences or story: How did you get involved in a career in tech? Why is computer science important to you? What are some things you do as part of your job and how does that relate to technology? 
- If you’ll be volunteering in-person, make sure you both understand local and school health and safety guidelines. Depending on their procedures you may need to arrive a little early. 
- If you’ll be volunteering virtually or in-person as this can determine what times you need to be present and in what capacity. 
- If you’re volunteering virtually, work with the teacher to determine the best video conferencing platform to use and try conducting a test run of the event together. 
- If the teacher has predetermined Hour of Code activities for the event, be aware so that you can [explore them](https://hourofcode.com/us/learn) ahead of time. 

### Think about your participants

- Consider the students you will be speaking to and what might resonate with them. As a volunteer, you can help them to realize that computing is everywhere and they too can become computer scientists. Consider their ages, backgrounds, and gender identities and come prepared with topics that may appeal to their interests. Here is additional guidance on how to inspire [young women](http://code.org/girls) to participate. 
- Get the students excited! Work with the teacher to pick out an [inspirational video](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources#videos) that can help focus the class and get them excited to do an Hour of Code. 
- If you are a virtual volunteer, consider making a few slides as part of your presentation to help keep students engaged.

## When you're hosting an event

If you are the host of an event with a classroom, use the sample agenda to guide you. Confirm the agreed schedule for the day and discuss any talking points with the teacher beforehand. If you are physically visiting the class, make sure you sign in with the school and greet the teacher the day-of your event.

If you’re considering hosting the Hour of Code at home or in the community, we recommend taking a look at some of our in-depth How-To Guides for [parents](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/parents) and [organizations or companies](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/companies).

|30-60 នាទី | កូដ! If your event is in-person, this is the time to answer questions and guide students through tough puzzles. Try not to give them the solution outright, instead, try asking them questions so they can answer themselves what went wrong, and encourage students to ask each other if they have questions. If you are volunteering virtually, work with the teacher on what the best approach might be. It may make more sense to return at the end of the session to see what progress students have made. | | |1-3 នាទី | អរគុណទាំងអស់គ្នា និង ចែករំលែកពាក្យដែលបំផុសគំនិត។ ប្រគល់នូវវត្ថុអនុស្សាវរីយផ្សេងៗរបស់ក្រុមហ៊ុន ([ស្ទីកឃ័រ](#celebrate) ល្អហ្មង)! | | <br />

- **Have low bandwidth**? Plan to show videos at the front of the event, so each participant isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline activities.

#### Virtual Events:

If your event is going to be virtual, you’ll want to decide on your conference platform (and test it) prior to your event. This may impact the number of students you feel comfortable engaging, so it’s best to determine this prior to inviting a classroom or promoting your event. For ideas on how to run a remote Hour of Code, read our [tips for a virtual Hour of Code event](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to/virtual).

### 4. Choose an activity

We provide a variety of fun, student-guided tutorials for all age groups and experience levels. It’s popular for students to try self-led tutorials, though you may want to begin the event with an [inspirational video](https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/resources#videos) for everyone to view together.

<a href="https://hourofcode.com/us/learn">Explore the activities</a> and decide ahead of time if you want to choose a single tutorial for all of your guests, or let each child pick their own. **All Hour of Code activities** require minimal prep-time, and are self-guided - allowing participants to work at their own pace and skill-level.

[![](/images/fit-700/tutorials.png)]({{ urls/learn }})

Once you have a solid roadmap for your event, you can then start inviting students, a school, or the larger community. We recommend starting with a local school you have a relationship with or [browsing our map](https://hourofcode.com/us/map) of Hour of Code events.

<a id="celebrate"></a>

### 5. Celebrate

[![](/images/fit-600/Marketing/2018_HoC-391.jpg)]({{ urls/learn }})

After students or guests have completed their Hour of Code, it’s time to celebrate their success. Here are some ideas for making your event even more fun:

- [Share certificates]({{ urls/certificates }}) for participants and students.
- [Print "I did an Hour of Code! stickers"]({{ promote/resources_stickers }}) or find other prizes and swag on the [Code.org Amazon Store](https://code.org/shop). 
- ចែករំលែករូបថតនិងវីដេអូនៃកម្មវិធី Hour of Code របស់អ្នកនៅលើប្រព័ន្ធផ្សព្វផ្សាយសង្គម។ ប្រើ #HourOfCode និង @codeorg ដើម្បីអោយយើងអាចបង្ហាញភាពជោគជ័យរបស់អ្នកផងដែរ!
