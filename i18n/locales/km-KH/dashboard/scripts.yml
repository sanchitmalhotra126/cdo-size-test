          description: |
            In this unit, students extend their understanding of the internet and how it functions by building off the concepts learned when sending bits in Unit 1. The unit largely explores the
            structure and design of the internet and the implications of those design decisions including
            the reliability of network communication, the security of data, and personal privacy. Topics
            include the Internet Protocol (IP), DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography and other security and hacking
            concerns.

          description: "PLEASE NOTE: this unit is still undergoing revisions based on pilot feedback from the 15-16 school year.  What's below is the planned sequence of lessons.  The revision work should be done by late fall or early winter 2016.  As a result: (1) lesson plans will still be in google docs (2) unit/lesson numbers on those docs may not match what you see below. DESCRIPTION: This unit continues the introduction of foundational concepts of computer programming, which unlocks the ability to make rich, interactive apps. This course uses JavaScript as the programming language, and App Lab as the programming environment to build apps, but the concepts learned in these lessons span all programming languages and tools."
